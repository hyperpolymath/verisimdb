Technical Specification: The KRaft Metadata Log

In VeriSimDB, the Registry is not a passive database but an active Replicated State Machine (RSM). Following the KRaft pattern, all metadata changes are treated as a sequence of events.

1. The Append-Only Ledger

Every change to the global namespace—whether a new Hexad registration or a policy update—is appended to a log.

Consensus: A change is only considered "Committed" once it has been replicated to a majority of the Registry Quorum.

Order: The log index ensures a total ordering of events, preventing "Split-Brain" scenarios in the federation.

2. Log Truncation & Snapshots

To maintain a "Tiny Core" footprint, the log is not infinite.

When the log exceeds the THRESHOLD_LIMIT, the current registryState (as defined in the ReScript types) is serialized into a Snapshot.

The log is then truncated, keeping only the snapshot and any entries created after it.

3. Pull-Based Follower Sync

Stores or passive registry nodes that have been offline do not wait for a push. They perform a Catch-up Pull:

Request the current Snapshot from the Leader.

Apply the snapshot to their local state.

Replay the remaining log entries from the lastIncludedIndex.

4. The "Trust Window" Integration

The KRaft log also stores the short-lived symmetric keys used for Trust Windows. By replicating these keys across the quorum, we ensure that a client can fail-over from one registry node to another without needing a "Heavy Handshake" re-authentication.
