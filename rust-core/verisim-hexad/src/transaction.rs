//! ACID Transaction Manager for VeriSimDB Hexad Operations
//!
//! Provides cross-modality atomicity for hexad operations. A hexad update must
//! either succeed across all 6 modalities or fail completely, preserving the
//! fundamental consistency guarantee of the hexad model.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The transaction manager implements:
//! - **Atomicity**: Undo log records previous state for rollback across modalities
//! - **Consistency**: Modality-level locks prevent partial updates
//! - **Isolation**: MVCC with configurable isolation levels (ReadCommitted, Serializable)
//! - **Durability**: Delegated to the underlying modality stores
//!
//! # Transaction State Machine
//!

//! # Deadlock Detection
//!
//! Uses a wait-for graph at modality granularity. When a transaction requests a
//! lock held by another transaction, the manager checks for cycles. If a cycle
//! is detected, the requesting transaction is aborted to break the deadlock.
