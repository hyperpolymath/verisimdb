= VeriSimDB Data Repository

Git-backed flat-file storage for scan results and drift detection data.

== Structure

- `scans/` - panic-attack scan results per repo
- `hardware/` - hardware-crash-team findings
- `drift/` - drift detection snapshots
- `index.json` - Master index of all stored data

== Usage

This repo receives scan results via GitHub Actions workflow_dispatch events
and stores them as JSON files. The ingest workflow updates the index
automatically.

== Integration

=== Sending Scan Results

Other repos can send scan results using the reusable workflow:

[source,yaml]
----
name: Security Scan
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly

jobs:
  scan:
    uses: hyperpolymath/panic-attacker/.github/workflows/scan-and-report.yml@main
----

=== Querying Results

Clone this repo and read the JSON files:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/verisimdb-data
cd verisimdb-data
cat scans/echidna.json  # View specific repo results
jq '.repos' index.json   # View all scan summaries
----

== File Format

Each scan result in `scans/` is a JSON file with the structure:

[source,json]
----
{
  "repo": "echidna",
  "scanned_at": "2026-02-08T12:00:00Z",
  "weak_points": [
    {
      "file": "src/main.rs",
      "line": 42,
      "category": "unwrap",
      "severity": "medium",
      "code": "let x = foo.unwrap();"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total": 15,
    "critical": 0,
    "high": 3,
    "medium": 8,
    "low": 4
  }
}
