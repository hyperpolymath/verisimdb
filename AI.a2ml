# Machine-Readable Metadata

Project metadata and AI agent configuration files are located in `.machine_readable/`:

- **STATE.scm** - Current project state, progress, blockers, next actions
- **ECOSYSTEM.scm** - Position in ecosystem, relationships to other projects
- **META.scm** - Architecture decisions, governance, development practices
- **PLAYBOOK.scm** - Operational runbook, procedures, alerts
- **AGENTIC.scm** - AI agent interaction patterns and constraints
- **NEUROSYM.scm** - Neurosymbolic integration configuration

**These files are the canonical source of truth for project metadata.**

## Workflow

1. Read `.machine_readable/*.scm` files at session start
2. Check STATE.scm for current phase, blockers, next actions
3. Follow patterns and constraints from AGENTIC.scm
4. Update STATE.scm after completing work
5. Sync to database: `~/sync-language-tracker.sh`
