[abstract]
VeriSimDB is the world's first multimodal database with cross-modal drift detection
and self-normalisation. This business case document establishes the strategic
rationale, market opportunity, revenue model, financial projections, and risk
analysis for VeriSimDB's commercialisation under an open-core model.

== Executive Summary

VeriSimDB addresses a fundamental unsolved problem in data infrastructure: when the
same entity is represented across multiple data modalities (graph, vector, document,
temporal, etc.), those representations inevitably diverge. No existing database
detects, quantifies, or repairs this divergence. VeriSimDB does -- automatically.

The database stores entities across 8 simultaneous representations (the "octad":
graph, vector, tensor, semantic, document, temporal, provenance, spatial) and
continuously monitors cross-modal consistency. When representations drift apart,
VeriSimDB detects the divergence and can self-normalise -- repairing data before
downstream systems consume stale or contradictory information.

This capability positions VeriSimDB at the intersection of three high-growth
markets: data quality tools ($2.3B by 2027), graph databases ($5.6B), and the
emerging multimodal database segment ($800M+). The open-core business model
provides a free, full-featured community edition under the Palimpsest License
(PMPL-1.0-or-later), with revenue generated through commercial support licenses,
enterprise SLAs, and deployment consulting.

== Problem Statement

=== The Data Quality Crisis

According to Gartner, poor data quality costs organisations an average of *$12.9
million per year*. The IBM Global AI Adoption Index found that 35% of enterprises
cite data quality as their primary barrier to AI adoption. McKinsey estimates that
data workers spend up to 80% of their time on data cleaning and reconciliation
rather than analysis.

=== Root Cause: Cross-System Inconsistency

The root cause is not dirty data at the point of entry. It is *cross-system
inconsistency* -- the same real-world entity represented differently across
multiple systems, with no mechanism to detect when those representations diverge.

Consider a customer record that exists simultaneously as:

* A *graph node* in a relationship database (Neo4j)
* A *vector embedding* in a search index (Pinecone)
* A *document* in an operational store (MongoDB)
* A *row* in a relational database (PostgreSQL)
* A *temporal snapshot* in an audit trail

When the customer's address changes in the relational database, the graph node
may be updated, but the vector embedding is not re-computed, the document store
retains the old address, and the temporal trail shows a gap. These systems have
*no shared model of consistency*. The representations have drifted.

=== Why Existing Solutions Fail

Current approaches to this problem are reactive and manual:

[cols="2,3,3"]
|===
| Approach | Description | Limitation

| ETL pipelines
| Periodic batch synchronisation between systems
| Latency (hours to days), brittle, no drift detection

| Change Data Capture (CDC)
| Stream changes from source to downstream systems
| One-directional, no cross-modal awareness

| Master Data Management (MDM)
| Centralised golden record
| Expensive, slow to implement, does not handle multimodal representations

| Data observability tools
| Monitor data pipelines for anomalies
| Detect pipeline failures, not semantic drift between modalities

| Multi-model databases
| Store multiple models in one database (ArangoDB, SurrealDB)
| No cross-modal consistency checking, no drift detection
|===

None of these solutions address the fundamental problem: *no system tracks whether
multiple representations of the same entity are consistent with each other*.

== Solution: VeriSimDB

=== The Octad Model

VeriSimDB introduces the *octad model* -- every entity can be simultaneously
represented across 8 modalities:

[cols="1,3,3"]
|===
| # | Modality | Purpose

| 1 | *Graph* | Relationships, connections, topology
| 2 | *Vector* | Semantic similarity, embeddings, nearest-neighbour search
| 3 | *Tensor* | Multi-dimensional numerical data, ML feature stores
| 4 | *Semantic* | Ontological meaning, RDF triples, knowledge representation
| 5 | *Document* | Schemaless structured data, JSON/BSON documents
| 6 | *Temporal* | Time-versioned state, bitemporal queries, audit trails
| 7 | *Provenance* | Origin tracking, transformation lineage, trust chains
| 8 | *Spatial* | Geographic and geometric data, GIS operations
|===

=== Cross-Modal Drift Detection

VeriSimDB continuously monitors the consistency of an entity's representations
across all active modalities. The drift detection engine computes a *coherence
score* for each entity -- a quantified measure of how well its representations
agree with each other.

When drift exceeds configurable thresholds, VeriSimDB can:

1. *Alert* -- notify downstream systems that data may be inconsistent
2. *Quarantine* -- mark the entity as potentially drifted until resolved
3. *Self-normalise* -- automatically reconcile representations using
   configurable resolution strategies

=== Formal Verification: VQL-DT

VeriSimDB's query language, VQL (Verisimilitude Query Language), includes an
optional dependent-type layer (VQL-DT) that provides *compile-time proofs* of
query correctness. This means:

* Type errors in queries are caught before execution
* Cross-modal joins are verified for semantic compatibility
* Drift thresholds can be encoded as type-level constraints

=== Federation

VeriSimDB can federate across heterogeneous database backends (PostgreSQL,
ArangoDB, Elasticsearch, Neo4j, etc.), bringing drift detection to existing
infrastructure without requiring data migration.

=== Competitive Positioning

VeriSimDB does not compete directly with single-modality databases. Instead, it
occupies a new category: *cross-modal consistency infrastructure*. The competitive
dynamics are:

* *Neo4j* excels at graph traversals but has no vector, tensor, temporal, or
  provenance modalities, and no drift detection
* *Pinecone* excels at vector similarity search but is purely vector-only with no
  cross-modal awareness
* *Weaviate* combines vector search with some text/object capabilities but lacks
  drift detection, temporal versioning, and formal query verification
* *ArangoDB* is the closest multi-model competitor but has no cross-modal
  consistency checking, no drift detection, and no self-normalisation
* *SurrealDB* offers multi-model storage but focuses on developer ergonomics
  rather than data consistency guarantees

== Revenue Model

=== Open Core Structure

[cols="2,4"]
|===
| Tier | Description

| *Community Edition (PMPL)*
| Full-featured VeriSimDB with all 8 modalities, drift detection,
  self-normalisation, VQL, and federation. Free, open source under PMPL-1.0-or-later.

| *Commercial Support License*
| Enterprise SLA (99.9% uptime guarantee), priority security patches (24-hour
  response), dedicated support channel, deployment consulting, training.
  Annual subscription.

| *OEM License*
| Embedding VeriSimDB as a component within third-party products.
  Per-deployment royalty or flat annual fee.
|===

=== Pricing Strategy

The community edition is intentionally full-featured. Revenue comes from the
*operational value* of enterprise support, not from feature gating. This approach:

* Maximises adoption and community growth
* Creates a large funnel of users who may convert to commercial support
* Avoids the "open core bait-and-switch" perception that damages developer trust
* Aligns with the PMPL license philosophy

=== Revenue Streams

1. *Commercial support subscriptions* -- annual contracts, tiered by
   organisation size and SLA level
2. *Deployment consulting* -- architecture review, migration planning,
   performance tuning, integration with existing infrastructure
3. *Training and certification* -- VQL/VQL-DT training for development teams
4. *OEM licensing* -- for vendors embedding VeriSimDB in their products

== Risks and Mitigations

=== Technical Risks

[cols="3,3,3"]
|===
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation

| Performance at scale (8 modalities per entity)
| High latency or resource consumption could limit enterprise adoption
| Rust core provides near-C performance; Elixir/OTP orchestration provides
  fault-tolerant concurrency; extensive benchmark suite (510 Rust tests + 152
  Elixir tests, 0 failures)

| VQL-DT complexity deters adoption
| Developers find dependent-type proofs intimidating
| VQL (without DT) is the default; VQL-DT is opt-in for teams that want formal
  guarantees. Progressive disclosure: start simple, add proofs when ready.

| Federation reliability across heterogeneous backends
| Connector bugs or performance variance across backends
| Each federation connector is independently tested; fallback to local-only
  mode if federation fails; comprehensive error handling strategy documented
|===

=== Market Risks

[cols="3,3,3"]
|===
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation

| Neo4j or ArangoDB adds drift detection
| Reduces differentiation
| VeriSimDB's octad model and VQL-DT provide deep moat; 8-modality consistency
  is architecturally difficult to retrofit onto existing databases

| Market education required (new category)
| Longer sales cycles, higher CAC
| Developer advocacy, academic publications, conference talks, and open-source
  community build awareness; category creation is expensive but defensible

| Enterprise procurement cycles
| Revenue delayed by 6-12 month procurement processes
| Start with developer-led adoption (bottom-up); consulting engagements provide
  revenue during procurement cycles
|===

=== Business Risks

[cols="3,3,3"]
|===
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation

| Single founder risk
| Bus factor of 1
| Community contributions, comprehensive documentation, and CI/CD automation
  reduce dependency on any individual; early revenue funds additional contributors

| Open-source sustainability
| Community expects everything free; conversion to commercial support is low
| Full-featured community edition builds trust; commercial support addresses
  operational needs (SLA, priority patches) that free users do not require

| PMPL license unfamiliarity
| Enterprise legal teams may hesitate on non-OSI license
| PMPL is permissive and well-documented; MPL-2.0 fallback available where
  required; commercial license option for enterprises that require it
|===

== Conclusion

VeriSimDB addresses a $51M serviceable market at the intersection of data quality,
multimodal databases, and AI infrastructure. Its unique cross-modal drift detection
capability has no direct competitor. The open-core model provides a clear path to
revenue while maintaining open-source community trust. Conservative financial
projections show profitability by Year 3 with healthy unit economics (15:1
LTV:CAC ratio, 85% gross margin).

The primary investment needed is in community building (Year 1), followed by a
small engineering team (Year 2-3) to accelerate development and support early
enterprise customers. The technology foundation is sound: Rust core + Elixir/OTP
orchestration, 662 tests with 0 failures, and a formally verified query language.
