[abstract]
Go-to-market strategy for VeriSimDB, structured in three phases: community-led
open source adoption, institutional partnerships in research and biomedicine,
and enterprise expansion in financial services and manufacturing. The strategy
is developer-led and bottom-up, reflecting VeriSimDB's current stage (alpha,
single developer) and the need to build credibility before pursuing enterprise
contracts.

== Strategic Positioning

=== Category Definition

VeriSimDB creates a new category: *cross-modal consistency infrastructure*.
This is distinct from:

* *Multi-model databases* (ArangoDB, SurrealDB) -- store multiple models but do
  not check consistency between them
* *Data quality tools* (Great Expectations, Monte Carlo) -- validate data within
  a single system, not across systems
* *Data integration platforms* (Fivetran, Airbyte) -- move data between systems
  but do not monitor ongoing consistency

The category-creation approach is deliberate. Competing within an established
category (graph databases, vector databases) positions VeriSimDB against
well-funded incumbents on their home turf. Creating a new category positions
VeriSimDB as the reference implementation for a problem that incumbents
do not address.

=== Positioning Statement

For *data engineers and platform teams* who struggle with *cross-system entity
inconsistency*, VeriSimDB is a *multimodal database with drift detection* that
*detects and repairs divergent representations automatically*. Unlike *multi-model
databases* (ArangoDB, SurrealDB) that store multiple models without consistency
checking, VeriSimDB *continuously monitors cross-modal coherence and
self-normalises drifted data*.

== Phase 1: Community-Led Growth (Months 0-12)

=== Objective

Establish VeriSimDB as the recognised solution for cross-modal drift detection
within developer communities where the problem is acutely felt.

|===

== Phase 2: Biomedical and Research Institutions (Months 12-24)

=== Objective

Secure 2-3 pilot deployments with research institutions where data quality is
critical and the octad model provides clear value.

=== Target Institutions

[cols="2,3,2"]
|===
| Sector | Why VeriSimDB | Entry Point

| *Bioinformatics labs*
| Multi-omics data integration requires consistency across genomic, proteomic,
and metabolomic representations
| ELIXIR network, ISMB/BOSC conference

| *Clinical research*
| Patient records span EHR, pharmacy, lab, and imaging systems with
life-safety implications for inconsistency
| OpenHIE community, AMIA conference

| *Climate science*
| Cross-sensor calibration verification and multi-archive federation
| Pangeo community, ESA CCI

| *Digital humanities*
| Knowledge graph quality assurance at scale (Wikidata, ConceptNet)
| Wikidata Workshop, ISWC conference
|===

=== Engagement Model

1. *Academic paper submission* (VLDB, SIGMOD, or EDBT) establishing the
   theoretical contribution
2. *Tutorial at domain conference* (ISMB for bioinformatics, AMIA for clinical)
   demonstrating VeriSimDB with domain-specific data
3. *Pilot partnership* with 1-2 labs, providing free deployment support in
   exchange for a published evaluation
4. *Grant applications* co-authored with institution partners (UKRI, Horizon
   Europe, NIH data commons)

=== Revenue Model (Phase 2)

Revenue in Phase 2 comes from *consulting engagements*, not software licences:

* Architecture review and deployment planning: $5,000-$15,000 per engagement
* Custom federation connector development: $10,000-$25,000 per connector
* Training workshops for research teams: $2,000-$5,000 per workshop

Target: 3-5 consulting engagements, $50,000-$150,000 total revenue.

== Phase 3: Enterprise Expansion (Months 24-36)

=== Objective

cross-system data consistency has measurable financial impact.

=== Target Verticals

[cols="2,3,2,1"]
|===
| Vertical | Pain Point | VeriSimDB Value | ACV

| *Financial services*
| AML/KYC compliance requires cross-system entity consistency; regulatory
penalties for inconsistent customer data
| Federation + drift detection across trading, compliance, and risk systems
| $50K+

| *Manufacturing*
| Digital twin synchronisation; IoT sensor data consistency across simulation
and physical state
| Temporal + spatial + provenance modalities; drift = simulation divergence
| $40K+

| *Pharmaceuticals*
| FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance; multi-system clinical trial data consistency
| Provenance + proof certificates for audit trails; drift = regulatory risk
| $60K+

| *Supply chain*
| End-to-end traceability; certification expiry detection across partner systems
| Federation + provenance + temporal modalities
| $35K+
|===

=== Go-to-Market Motion

==== Developer-Led (Bottom-Up)

The expected enterprise sales motion for VeriSimDB is bottom-up:

1. A data engineer discovers VeriSimDB through a blog post, conference talk,
   or community recommendation
2. The engineer evaluates VeriSimDB in a staging environment, running drift
   detection on a subset of production data
3. The engineer demonstrates results to their team lead or VP Engineering,
   showing quantified drift across existing systems
4. The team requests an architecture review (consulting engagement, $5K-$15K)
5. Successful evaluation leads to a commercial support licence ($40K+/year)

This motion has a *low CAC* ($8,000 estimated) because the developer does the
evaluation and internal selling. Traditional enterprise sales (outbound SDR,
demo, POC, procurement) costs $30,000-$50,000 per customer.

==== Partner Channel (Secondary, Phase 3b)

After establishing 5-10 commercial customers through developer-led adoption:

* Engage system integrators (Accenture, Deloitte, Thoughtworks) who advise
  enterprise clients on data infrastructure
* Create partner training programme (VQL certification)
* Provide referral incentives (10-15% of first-year ACV)

=== Commercial Support Licence

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
| Tier | ACV | Includes

| *Standard*
| $25,000
| Email support (48h response), security patches (7-day response), quarterly
architecture review call

| *Professional*
| $40,000
| Priority email + Slack support (24h response), security patches (48h response),
monthly architecture review, deployment consulting (8 hours/quarter)

| *Enterprise*
| $75,000
| Dedicated support channel (4h response), security patches (24h response),
weekly architecture review, unlimited deployment consulting, on-site training
(2 days/year)
|===

All tiers include the same software. No feature gating. The commercial licence
provides operational guarantees and expert access, not additional functionality.

=== Success Metrics (Month 36)

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
| Metric | Target | Rationale

| Commercial customers | 10-15 | Validates enterprise product-market fit
| ARR | $400K-$600K | Path to sustainability without external funding
| GitHub stars | 5,000+ | Top-tier OSS database project recognition
| External contributors | 25+ | Self-sustaining community
| Published papers | 3-5 | Ongoing academic credibility
| Conference talks | 10+ cumulative | Established speaker in database conferences
|===

== Risk Mitigation

=== Phase 1 Risks

[cols="2,3,3"]
|===
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation

| Low community adoption
| No awareness, no pipeline for Phase 2
| Focus on GraphRAG community (strongest alignment); create compelling demo;
engage consistently (48h issue response)

| Competitor adds drift detection
| Reduces differentiation
| 8-modality octad model is architecturally difficult to retrofit; deep moat in
VQL-DT formal verification; first-mover advantage in category definition
|===

=== Phase 2 Risks

[cols="2,3,3"]
|===
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation

| Academic paper rejected
| Delays credibility building
| Submit to multiple venues; prepare demo paper as backup; publish preprint on
arXiv regardless of venue acceptance

| No institution willing to pilot
| Consulting revenue delayed
| Offer free deployment support. Lower barrier: "let us run drift detection
on your data for free." Publication incentive for academics.
|===

=== Phase 3 Risks

[cols="2,3,3"]
|===
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation

| Enterprise procurement delay (6-12 months)
| Revenue delayed; cash flow pressure
| Consulting revenue bridges gap. Developer-led adoption reduces procurement
friction. Start enterprise conversations 6 months before Phase 3.

| Single-founder scaling limit
| Cannot support 10+ enterprise customers alone
| Early revenue funds first hire (DevRel or support engineer); comprehensive
documentation and automation reduce per-customer effort.
|===

== Budget Summary

[cols="2,1,1,1"]
|===
| Item | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3

| Infrastructure (hosting, CI/CD)
| $500
| $2,000
| $10,000

| Conference travel
| $2,000
| $5,000
| $10,000

| Marketing (domain, design)
| $500
| $1,000
| $5,000

| Personnel (contract)
| $0
| $0
| $50,000

| *Total*
| *$3,000*
| *$8,000*
| *$75,000*
|===

Phase 1 and 2 are self-funded. Phase 3 personnel costs are covered by
commercial support revenue.
