[abstract]
Phased adoption roadmap for VeriSimDB, from open-source community building
through institutional pilots to enterprise deployment. Each phase has specific
milestones, success criteria, exit conditions, and contingency plans. The roadmap
is designed to be achievable by a single developer (Phase 1) scaling to a small
team (Phase 2-3).

== Phase 1: GraphRAG Community (Months 0-12)

=== Objective

Establish VeriSimDB as the recognised solution for cross-modal drift detection,
starting with the GraphRAG community where the problem is most acutely felt.

=== Why GraphRAG First

The GraphRAG community is the ideal starting point for three reasons:

1. *Immediate pain point*: RAG pipelines that combine vector databases with
   knowledge graphs suffer from embedding drift -- the exact problem VeriSimDB
   detects. LangChain's documentation explicitly acknowledges the need for
   "indexing APIs with cleanup processes" to keep vector stores synchronised
   with source documents.

2. *Technical alignment*: GraphRAG architectures use 3-4 of VeriSimDB's 8
   modalities (graph, vector, document, sometimes semantic). This is enough to
   demonstrate value without requiring the full octad.

3. *Accessible community*: The GraphRAG community is active on GitHub, Discord,
   and Reddit. It is developer-led, open-source-friendly, and values technical
   demonstrations over marketing claims.

=== Success Criteria (Exit Conditions for Phase 2)

Phase 2 entry requires meeting *at least 4 of 6* criteria:

[cols="1,3,1"]
|===
| # | Criterion | Target

| 1 | GitHub stars | >= 500
| 2 | Monthly unique cloners | >= 100
| 3 | External pull requests (merged) | >= 5
| 4 | Open issues from external users | >= 15
| 5 | Blog post cumulative views | >= 10,000
| 6 | Conference talks given or accepted | >= 2
|===

=== Contingency: Phase 1 Stalls

If fewer than 3 criteria are met at Month 12:

* *Diagnose*: Analyse which content performed best, which communities engaged,
  which demo resonated. The problem may be messaging, not product.
* *Pivot community*: If GraphRAG is not responding, try the data quality
  community (Great Expectations users) or the Elixir community (OTP angle).
* *Extend Phase 1*: Add 6 months. The product is open source and self-funded --
  there is no investor pressure to advance phases.
* *Minimum threshold*: If GitHub stars < 100 at Month 12, reassess whether the
  product-market fit hypothesis is correct. Consider a fundamental messaging
  change.

== Phase 2: Biomedical and Research Institutions (Months 12-24)

=== Objective

Secure 2-3 pilot deployments with research institutions where data quality is
critical, multi-modal data is the norm, and the academic community provides
credibility leverage.

=== Why Biomedical/Research Second

1. *Natural octad fit*: Biomedical data (multi-omics, clinical records, imaging)
   uses 6-8 of VeriSimDB's modalities. The octad model is not an academic
   abstraction -- it maps directly to how biological data exists.

2. *Regulatory motivation*: FDA 21 CFR Part 11, EMA GxP requirements, and grant
   agency data management plans create institutional demand for data consistency
   tools with audit trails (provenance modality) and formal verification
   (VQL-DT proof certificates).

3. *Publication opportunity*: Successful pilot deployments generate academic
   papers, which generate citations, which generate credibility. A VLDB or
   SIGMOD publication is worth more than 1,000 GitHub stars for enterprise
   credibility.

4. *Budget availability*: Research institutions have grant budgets for data
   infrastructure. These budgets are smaller than enterprise IT budgets but have
   shorter procurement cycles and fewer compliance hurdles.

|===

=== Target Institutions

[cols="2,2,3"]
|===
| Type | Examples | VeriSimDB Value

| *Bioinformatics labs*
| EBI (Cambridge), Sanger Institute, Broad Institute
| Multi-omics data consistency across genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic
representations

| *Clinical research centres*
| NHS Digital, academic medical centres
| Cross-system patient record consistency (EHR + pharmacy + lab + imaging)

| *Digital humanities*
| Wikidata, British Library, Europeana
| Knowledge graph quality assurance, ontological consistency at scale

| *Climate science*
| CEDA (UK), DKRZ (Germany), ESA CCI
| Cross-sensor calibration verification, multi-archive federation
|===

=== Engagement Model

1. *Initial contact*: Through academic conference, community forum, or direct
   outreach to data management teams
2. *Architecture review*: Free 2-hour consultation to understand their data
   consistency challenges and assess VeriSimDB fit
3. *Pilot agreement*: Formal agreement covering scope, timeline, success metrics,
   and publication rights
4. *Deployment support*: Free deployment support for the pilot (investment in
   case study material)
5. *Evaluation and publication*: Joint paper or case study documenting results

=== Revenue Model (Phase 2)

Revenue comes from consulting, not software licences:

[cols="2,1,3"]
|===
| Service | Price | Description

| Architecture review
| $5,000-$15,000
| Assessment of data consistency challenges, VeriSimDB fit, deployment plan

| Custom federation connector
| $10,000-$25,000
| Development of a federation connector for the institution's specific backend
(e.g., OpenClinica, REDCap, iRODS)

| Training workshop
| $2,000-$5,000
| Half-day or full-day VQL training for the institution's development team

| Ongoing consulting
| $150-$250/hour
| Architecture guidance, performance tuning, VQL query optimisation
|===

*Target:* 3-5 consulting engagements, $50,000-$150,000 total revenue.

=== Success Criteria (Exit Conditions for Phase 3)

Phase 3 entry requires meeting *at least 4 of 6* criteria:

[cols="1,3,1"]
|===
| # | Criterion | Target

| 1 | Pilot deployments completed | >= 2
| 2 | Academic papers published or accepted | >= 1
| 3 | Consulting revenue (cumulative) | >= $50,000
| 4 | GitHub stars | >= 2,000
| 5 | External contributors (active in last 90 days) | >= 10
| 6 | Conference talks given (cumulative) | >= 5
|===

=== Contingency: Phase 2 Stalls

If fewer than 3 criteria are met at Month 24:

* *Pivot domain*: If bioinformatics is not responding, try digital twins
  (manufacturing) or data mesh (enterprise data teams). Different domains have
  different adoption timescales.
* *Strengthen Phase 1*: More community content, more conference talks, more
  integration guides. Phase 2 may fail because Phase 1 did not build enough
  awareness.
* *Reassess product-market fit*: If no institution is willing to pilot, the
  problem may be less acute than hypothesised. Consider whether drift detection
  is a "nice to have" versus "must have" for the target audience.

== Phase 3: Enterprise Expansion (Months 24-36)

=== Objective

Launch commercial support licences and expand into enterprise markets where
cross-system data consistency has measurable financial impact ($12.9M/year
per Gartner).

=== Why Enterprise Third

1. *Credibility required*: Enterprise buyers require proof of capability --
   case studies, academic publications, and production deployments. Phases 1-2
   build this credibility.

2. *Procurement cycles*: Enterprise procurement takes 6-12 months. Starting
   enterprise sales in Phase 1 would mean no revenue until Month 18-24 anyway.
   Building community and institutional credibility during that period is a
   better use of time.

3. *Product maturity*: Enterprise deployment requires production hardening,
   security review, monitoring tooling, and operational documentation that are
   not needed for community or research use.

=== Sales Motion

==== Developer-Led (Primary)

The expected enterprise sales motion for VeriSimDB is bottom-up:

1. A data engineer discovers VeriSimDB through a blog post, conference talk,
   or community recommendation
2. The engineer evaluates VeriSimDB in a staging environment, running drift
   detection on a subset of production data
3. The engineer demonstrates results to their team lead or VP Engineering,
   showing quantified drift across existing systems
4. The team requests an architecture review (consulting engagement, $5K-$15K)
5. Successful evaluation leads to a commercial support licence purchase

This motion has a *low CAC* ($8,000 estimated) because the developer does the
evaluation and internal selling. Traditional enterprise sales (outbound SDR,
demo, POC, procurement) costs $30,000-$50,000 per customer.

==== Partner Channel (Secondary, Phase 3b)

After establishing 5-10 commercial customers:

* Engage system integrators (Accenture, Deloitte, Thoughtworks) who advise
  enterprise clients on data infrastructure
* Create partner training programme (VQL certification)
* Provide referral incentives (10-15% of first-year ACV)

=== Success Criteria (Phase 3)

[cols="1,3,1"]
|===
| # | Criterion | Target

| 1 | Commercial support customers | >= 5
| 2 | ARR | >= $200,000
| 3 | GitHub stars | >= 5,000
| 4 | External contributors (active in last 90 days) | >= 25
| 5 | Managed service users (pilot) | >= 2
| 6 | Published case studies | >= 3
|===

== Technical Readiness by Phase

Each phase requires specific technical capabilities. These are development
priorities, not marketing milestones.

[cols="3,1,1,1"]
|===
| Capability | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3

| Core octad storage (all 8 modalities) | Required | Required | Required
| Drift detection and coherence scoring | Required | Required | Required
| Self-normalisation (configurable strategies) | Required | Required | Required
| VQL parser and query execution | Required | Required | Required
| Getting-started guide and VQL examples | Required | Required | Required
| Federation (PostgreSQL connector) | Demo quality | Production quality | Production quality
| Federation (ArangoDB, Elasticsearch, Neo4j) | Not required | Demo quality | Production quality
| VQL-DT proof certificates | Documented design | Prototype | Production quality
| Container images (Podman/Docker) | Basic | Hardened | Production-grade
| Monitoring and alerting (Prometheus) | Basic | Comprehensive | SLA-grade
| RBAC and access control | Not required | Basic | Comprehensive
| Backup and restore | Not required | Basic | Automated
| Multi-node deployment | Not required | Not required | Documented + tested
| Managed service infrastructure | Not required | Not required | Pilot
|===

== Risk Register

[cols="1,2,1,3"]
|===
| Phase | Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation

| 1
| Low community adoption
| Medium
| Diversify community targets (GraphRAG, Elixir, Rust, data quality). Create
compelling demo. Engage consistently.

| 1
| Competitor adds drift detection
| Low
| Architectural depth (octad + VQL-DT) is difficult to retrofit. First-mover
advantage in category definition.

| 2
| No institution willing to pilot
| Medium
| Offer free deployment support. Lower barrier: "let us run drift detection
on your data for free." Publication incentive for academics.

| 2
| Academic paper rejected
| Medium
| Submit to multiple venues. Prepare demo paper as backup. Publish preprint
on arXiv regardless.

| 3
| Enterprise procurement delay (6-12 months)
| High
| Consulting revenue bridges gap. Developer-led adoption reduces procurement
friction. Start enterprise conversations 6 months before Phase 3.

| 3
| Single-founder scaling limit
| High
| First hire (DevRel) at Month 12. Second hire (Rust engineer) at Month 18.
Revenue from Phase 2 consulting funds initial hires.

| All
| Burnout (single developer, 36-month plan)
| High
| Sustainable pace: no artificial urgency. VeriSimDB is self-funded; there
are no investor milestones. Take breaks. The project advances when it advances.
