== Macro-Economic Analysis

=== Market Landscape

VeriSimDB operates at the intersection of three established and one emerging
market segment. The following analysis uses industry reports from 2024-2026
to size the addressable opportunity.

==== Data Quality Tools Market

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Metric | Value

| Global market size (2024) | $1.7 billion
| Projected market size (2027) | $2.3 billion (MarketsAndMarkets)
| CAGR | 10.5%
| Key drivers | AI adoption (data quality as prerequisite), regulatory compliance
(GDPR, CCPA, FDA 21 CFR Part 11), cloud migration (multi-system architectures)
| Key players | Informatica, Talend, IBM, Collibra, Great Expectations, Monte Carlo
|===

VeriSimDB's relevance to this market is through *cross-system consistency* --
a specific and currently unaddressed category of data quality. Existing tools
focus on schema validation (Great Expectations), pipeline observability (Monte
Carlo), or master data management (Informatica). None detect cross-modal drift
between different representation types of the same entity.

*Addressable sub-segment:* Approximately 20% of data quality spend is related to
cross-system inconsistency resolution (ETL repair, manual reconciliation, MDM
maintenance). This yields a sub-segment of approximately *$460 million* by 2027.

==== Graph Database Market

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Metric | Value

| Global market size (2024) | $3.8 billion
| Projected market size (2028) | $5.6 billion (Grand View Research)
| CAGR | 10.2%
| Key drivers | Knowledge graphs, fraud detection, recommendation engines,
GraphRAG architectures
| Key players | Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, TigerGraph, ArangoDB, JanusGraph
|===

VeriSimDB is not a graph database competitor. However, approximately 5% of
graph database customers operate multi-model architectures (graph + vector +
document) where cross-modal consistency is a concern. This yields a
sub-segment of approximately *$280 million* by 2028.

==== Vector Database Market

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Metric | Value

| Global market size (2024) | $800 million
| Projected market size (2027) | $1.2 billion (estimated, no consensus report)
| CAGR | 14.9%
| Key drivers | LLM/RAG architectures, semantic search, recommendation systems
| Key players | Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, Milvus, Chroma
|===

The vector database market is the most rapidly growing segment and the most
directly relevant to VeriSimDB's Phase 1 strategy (GraphRAG community). Teams
building RAG pipelines combine vector databases with knowledge graphs and
document stores -- precisely the multimodal architecture where drift detection
provides value.

*Addressable sub-segment:* Approximately 10% of vector database customers
operate hybrid vector + graph architectures. This yields a sub-segment of
approximately *$120 million* by 2027.

==== Emerging: Multimodal Database Segment

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Metric | Value

| Estimated market size (2026) | $800 million (analyst estimates, no formal report)
| Projected market size (2030) | $2.5 billion
| CAGR | ~33% (emerging market, high uncertainty)
| Key drivers | AI/ML infrastructure, multi-model consolidation, data quality
| Key players | ArangoDB (multi-model), SurrealDB (multi-model), VeriSimDB
(multimodal with drift detection)
|===

This segment is nascent and poorly defined. The distinction between
"multi-model" (multiple query models over a single storage engine) and
"multimodal" (multiple representation types with consistency guarantees) is
not yet recognised by analysts. VeriSimDB has an opportunity to define the
category.

=== Combined Market Opportunity

[cols="2,1,1,1"]
|===
| Segment | TAM | SAM (Addressable Sub-Segment) | SOM (1% Serviceable)

| Data Quality Tools | $2.3B | $460M | $23M
| Graph Databases | $5.6B | $280M | $14M
| Vector Databases | $1.2B | $120M | $6M
| Multimodal Databases | $800M | $160M | $8M
| *Combined* | | | *$51M*
|===

The *$51 million SOM* represents a conservative 1% capture of the addressable
sub-segments. This is achievable with 50-100 enterprise customers at an average
ACV of $40,000-$50,000.

=== Macro Tailwinds

Several macro-economic trends favour VeriSimDB's positioning:

AI adoption driving multi-system architectures::
  Every AI/ML pipeline adds at least one new data store (vector database for
  embeddings, graph database for knowledge graphs). This increases the number of
  systems holding representations of the same entity, making cross-modal drift
  more likely and more costly.

Regulatory pressure on data consistency::
  GDPR (right to erasure across all systems), FDA 21 CFR Part 11 (electronic
  records integrity), SOX (financial data accuracy), and emerging AI regulations
  (EU AI Act) all create compliance requirements for cross-system data consistency.
  Organisations that cannot demonstrate consistency face fines and audit failures.

Cloud migration creating data fragmentation::
  Organisations migrating to cloud adopt specialised managed services (RDS,
  DynamoDB, Neptune, OpenSearch, Pinecone) rather than consolidating on a single
  database. This polyglot persistence pattern is the root cause of cross-modal
  drift.

Open source as default infrastructure::
  The database market has shifted to open-source-first adoption. PostgreSQL,
  MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Redis are all open source or source-available.
  VeriSimDB's open-core model aligns with this expectation.

=== Macro Headwinds

Market education required::
  "Cross-modal drift detection" is not a recognised category. Potential customers
  do not know they have this problem until they see it demonstrated. Category
  creation is expensive and time-consuming.

Consolidation pressure::
  Large database vendors (MongoDB, Snowflake, Databricks) are adding multi-model
  capabilities. They may eventually add drift detection as a feature, competing
  with VeriSimDB using existing market position.

Economic uncertainty::
  IT budget constraints during economic downturns delay new infrastructure
  adoption. Data quality is often deprioritised relative to revenue-generating
  features.

== Micro-Economic Analysis

=== Competitive Pricing Analysis

[cols="2,2,2,3"]
|===
| Product | Free Tier | Commercial Price | Notes

| *Neo4j*
| Community Edition (GPLv3)
| Enterprise: from $36,000/year; AuraDB: from $65/month
| Community Edition lacks clustering, role-based access, and monitoring.
Enterprise features are gated.

| *Pinecone*
| Starter: 1 index, 100K vectors
| Standard: from $70/month; Enterprise: custom pricing (typically $25K+/year)
| Fully managed, cloud-only. No self-hosted option. Pricing scales with vector
count and query volume.

| *Weaviate*
| Open source (BSD-3)
| Weaviate Cloud: from $25/month; Enterprise: custom pricing
| Open source is full-featured. Cloud service adds managed infrastructure.
Enterprise adds SLA and support.

| *ArangoDB*
| Community Edition (Apache 2.0)
| ArangoGraph: from $99/month; Enterprise: custom pricing (est. $30K+/year)
| Community Edition is full-featured. Enterprise adds SmartGraphs, satellite
collections, and dedicated support.

| *SurrealDB*
| Open source (BSL 1.1)
| SurrealDB Cloud: beta (pricing TBD); Enterprise: not yet available
| BSL restricts commercial use (converts to Apache 2.0 after 3 years).
Cloud service is in beta.

| *Qdrant*
| Open source (Apache 2.0)
| Qdrant Cloud: from $25/month; Enterprise: custom pricing
| Full-featured open source. Cloud adds managed infrastructure.

| *VeriSimDB*
| Community Edition (PMPL)
| Standard: $25,000/year; Professional: $40,000/year; Enterprise: $75,000/year
| Full-featured community edition. Commercial licence provides support and SLA,
not additional features.
|===

=== Pricing Strategy

==== Principle: No Feature Gating

VeriSimDB's commercial licence does *not* add features beyond the community
edition. All 8 modalities, drift detection, self-normalisation, VQL, VQL-DT,
and federation ship in the open-source release.

This is a deliberate strategic choice:

1. *Maximises adoption*: Developers can evaluate the full product without hitting
   artificial limits. There is no "upgrade to Enterprise for clustering" moment
   that creates friction.

2. *Builds trust*: The open-source community is increasingly sceptical of
   "open core" models that gate essential features. Full-featured community
   editions (Weaviate, ArangoDB Community) earn developer trust.

3. *Targets operational value*: Enterprise customers pay for SLAs, priority
   patches, deployment consulting, and expert access -- not for features. The
   operational value of "24-hour security patch response" is worth $40,000/year
   to a financial services firm; the feature itself (the patch) is free.

==== Pricing Tiers

[cols="1,1,4"]
|===
| Tier | ACV | Value Proposition

| *Standard*
| $25,000
| For teams that need a support safety net. Email support with 48-hour response.
Security patches within 7 days. Quarterly architecture review call.
"Insurance policy" positioning.

| *Professional*
| $40,000
| For teams running VeriSimDB in production. Priority support with 24-hour
response. Security patches within 48 hours. Monthly architecture review.
8 hours/quarter of deployment consulting included.
"Operational confidence" positioning.

| *Enterprise*
| $75,000
| For organisations with strict compliance requirements. Dedicated support
channel with 4-hour response. Security patches within 24 hours. Weekly
architecture review. Unlimited consulting. On-site training (2 days/year).
"Compliance-grade support" positioning.
|===

==== Pricing Rationale

The $40,000 Professional tier is the target ACV, positioned as follows:

* *Below* Neo4j Enterprise ($36K+ but typically $50K-$100K with all modules),
  making it easy for prospects to justify budget
* *Above* Weaviate Cloud and ArangoDB Cloud managed service costs, reflecting
  the additional value of drift detection and formal verification
* *Competitive* with Pinecone Enterprise pricing ($25K+/year), which provides
  only vector search (1 modality) versus VeriSimDB's 8 modalities
* *Aligned* with industry benchmarks for open-source database support (Red Hat
  OpenShift subscriptions, Canonical Ubuntu Pro, Elastic subscriptions)

=== Unit Economics

[cols="2,1,3"]
|===
| Metric | Value | Derivation

| *Average Contract Value (ACV)*
| $40,000
| Professional tier, most common entry point

| *Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)*
| $8,000
| Developer-led adoption reduces traditional enterprise sales cost; estimated
as 3 months of DevRel + content costs per conversion

| *LTV:CAC Ratio*
| 15:1
| 3-year average retention at $40K ACV = $120K LTV; $120K / $8K = 15:1.
Target > 3:1 is considered healthy.

| *Payback Period*
| 2.4 months
| $8K CAC / ($40K ACV / 12 months) = 2.4 months. Target < 12 months.

| *Gross Margin*
| 85%
| Software + support. COGS is primarily support engineer time (15% of ACV).

| *Net Revenue Retention (NRR)*
| 115%
| Expansion from Standard to Professional to Enterprise, plus consulting
add-ons. 5% annual churn offset by 20% expansion.

| *Annual Churn*
| 5%
| Conservative estimate. Open-source databases have lower churn than proprietary
because customers continue using the free edition even if they cancel support.

| *Customer Lifetime*
| 3 years
| Average enterprise support contract duration.
|===

=== Break-Even Analysis

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Scenario | Customers Needed | Revenue

| *Minimum viable* (1 employee + founder)
| 3 Professional contracts
| $120,000 (covers 1 DevRel hire + infrastructure)

| *Stage 1 team* (3-5 people)
| 8-10 mixed contracts
| $300,000-$400,000 (covers core team compensation)

| *Self-sustaining* (10-15 people)
| 20-25 mixed contracts
| $800,000-$1,000,000 (covers full org + overhead)
|===

=== Revenue Projection

[cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
| | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4

| *Community users* | 500 | 2,000 | 5,000 | 10,000
| *Standard contracts* | 0 | 2 | 5 | 10
| *Professional contracts* | 0 | 1 | 5 | 15
| *Enterprise contracts* | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3
| *Consulting engagements* | 0 | 3 | 5 | 8
| *Consulting revenue* | $0 | $45,000 | $75,000 | $120,000
| *Licence revenue* | $0 | $90,000 | $325,000 | $775,000
| *Total revenue* | $0 | $135,000 | $400,000 | $895,000
| *Total costs* | $3,000 | $104,000 | $365,000 | $700,000
| *Operating profit* | -$3,000 | $31,000 | $35,000 | $195,000
|===

The conservative projection reaches *operating profitability in Year 2* through
consulting revenue, with licence revenue becoming the primary driver by Year 3.

== Sensitivity Analysis

=== Best Case

* Community adoption exceeds expectations (GitHub trending, viral blog post)
* First enterprise customer acquired in Year 1
* Year 3 revenue: $800,000 (double the conservative projection)

=== Worst Case

* Community adoption is slow (< 200 stars in Year 1)
* No enterprise customers until Year 3
* Year 3 revenue: $100,000 (consulting only)
* Mitigation: VeriSimDB remains a viable open-source project even without
  commercial revenue; the founder's academic position provides baseline income

=== Key Variables

[cols="2,3,1"]
|===
| Variable | Impact | Sensitivity

| Community adoption rate
| Determines pipeline for enterprise conversion
| High

| Enterprise sales cycle length
| 6-12 months typical; longer delays revenue
| High

| Competitor response (Neo4j adds drift detection)
| Reduces differentiation but VeriSimDB has
architectural depth advantage (octad + VQL-DT)
| Medium

| Pricing acceptance ($40K ACV)
| May need to lower to $25K for early adopters
| Medium

| Churn rate
| 5% assumed; 10% would reduce LTV by 33%
| Medium
|===

== Investment Considerations

=== Self-Funded Path

VeriSimDB can reach sustainability without external investment:

* Year 1: Self-funded ($3,000 budget)
* Year 2: First revenue from consulting ($135,000); hire DevRel lead
* Year 3: Licence revenue begins ($400,000); hire core engineering team
* Year 4: Self-sustaining ($895,000 revenue, $195,000 operating profit)

This path is slower but preserves full ownership and avoids the pressure to
scale prematurely.

=== External Funding (If Pursued)

If external funding is sought, the appropriate stage would be:

* *Pre-seed / Angel* ($100K-$250K, Year 1-2): Accelerate community building,
  hire DevRel lead 6 months earlier, attend more conferences
* *Seed* ($500K-$1M, Year 2-3): Hire full Stage 1 team, accelerate enterprise
  sales, develop managed service
* *Series A* ($3M-$5M, Year 3-4): Scale to Stage 3 organisation, launch
  managed service, expand internationally

The self-funded path is the current plan. External funding is documented here
for completeness, not as a recommendation.
