[abstract]
Organisational structure required to develop, market, support, and operate
VeriSimDB at each growth stage. The structure evolves from a single-developer
open source project through a small focused team to a sustainable organisation
capable of supporting enterprise customers.

toc::[]

== Current State (Solo Developer)

VeriSimDB is currently developed and maintained by a single developer
(Jonathan D.A. Jewell). All functions -- engineering, documentation, testing,
community engagement, infrastructure, and strategy -- are performed by one
person.

This is viable for the community-building phase (Phase 1) but will not scale
to support enterprise customers, multiple pilot deployments, or sustained
conference presence.

The functional unit plan below describes the minimal team needed at each growth
stage, not an aspirational org chart. Each role is justified by a specific
bottleneck that a single developer cannot resolve alone.

== Stage 1: Core Team (3-5 People, Months 12-18)

=== Engineering (2-3 People)

==== Rust Core Engineer (1 person)

*Justification:* The Rust core (storage engine, drift detection, indexing) is
the most performance-critical and complex subsystem. A dedicated Rust engineer
enables parallel development of modality stores, query optimisation, and
federation connectors while the founder focuses on architecture and community.

*Responsibilities:*

* Develop and maintain Rust crates (`verisim-graph`, `verisim-vector`,
  `verisim-drift`, `verisim-normalizer`, etc.)
* Performance benchmarking and optimisation
* Federation connector development (PostgreSQL, ArangoDB, Elasticsearch, Neo4j)
* CI/CD pipeline maintenance (Rust builds, cross-compilation)

*Skills required:*

* Strong Rust experience (3+ years), including async and FFI
* Database internals knowledge (indexing, query planning, storage engines)
* Experience with at least one graph or vector database

*Hiring signal:* When the first external contributor submits a non-trivial Rust
PR, the candidate pool includes people who already understand the codebase.

==== Elixir/OTP Engineer (1 person)

*Justification:* The Elixir orchestration layer (GenServer-per-entity,
supervision trees, distributed coordination) requires OTP expertise that is
distinct from Rust systems programming. An Elixir engineer enables development
of advanced fault tolerance, distributed consensus, and hot code reloading
capabilities.

*Responsibilities:*

* Develop and maintain Elixir orchestration layer (`VeriSim.EntityServer`,
  `VeriSim.DriftMonitor`, `VeriSim.QueryRouter`)
* Hypatia integration pipeline (`ScanIngester`, `PatternQuery`, `DispatchBridge`)
* Distributed coordination (multi-node deployment, consensus)
* Monitoring and observability (Prometheus metrics, Telemetry events)

*Skills required:*

* Elixir/OTP experience (2+ years), including GenServer, Supervisor, and
  distributed Erlang
* Understanding of BEAM concurrency model
* Experience with Phoenix or similar Elixir web frameworks (for HTTP API)

==== Generalist / Zig-Idris2 Specialist (0-1 person, contract)

*Justification:* The ABI/FFI layer (Idris2 definitions, Zig bindings, generated
C headers) requires a rare skill combination. This role may be filled by a
contractor or part-time contributor rather than a full-time hire, given the
narrow scope.

*Responsibilities:*

* Maintain Idris2 ABI definitions and dependent-type proofs
* Develop and maintain Zig FFI bindings
* Generate and validate C headers
* Ensure ABI/FFI compliance across platforms

*Skills required:*

* Idris2 or Agda experience (dependent types)
* Zig experience (C ABI, cross-compilation)
* Understanding of FFI patterns and memory management

=== Developer Relations (1 person)

==== DevRel Lead

*Justification:* The single-biggest bottleneck for Phase 2 (institutional
partnerships) is the founder's time. A DevRel lead handles documentation,
community engagement, conference submissions, and content creation -- freeing
the founder for architecture decisions and enterprise conversations.

*Responsibilities:*

* Write and maintain documentation (getting-started guide, tutorials, API
  reference)
* Create content (blog posts, conference talks, video tutorials)
* Manage community channels (GitHub issues, forum discussions, social media)
* Submit conference talk proposals and prepare presentations
* Coordinate with academic collaborators on paper submissions

*Skills required:*

* Technical writing ability (can explain database concepts to developers)
* Conference speaking experience
* Familiarity with database or data engineering communities
* Ability to write code examples in at least one of Rust, Elixir, or ReScript

*Hiring signal:* When community engagement (GitHub issues, forum posts) exceeds
what one person can respond to within 48 hours.

=== Operations (0.5 person, shared with Engineering)

In Stage 1, operations responsibilities are shared across the engineering team:

* CI/CD pipeline maintenance (GitHub Actions, SLSA, SBOM)
* Container image builds and registry management
* Infrastructure provisioning (staging environment for demos)
* Security patching and dependency updates

No dedicated operations hire is needed until enterprise customers require SLA
guarantees.

== Stage 2: Growth Team (6-10 People, Months 18-30)

=== Engineering (4-5 People)

The Stage 1 engineering team expands with:

==== Query Engine Engineer (1 person)

*Justification:* VQL and VQL-DT require dedicated attention as query complexity
grows. The query planner (currently basic) needs optimisation for cross-modal
queries spanning all 8 modalities.

*Responsibilities:*

* VQL parser and query planner development
* VQL-DT type checker integration (Idris2 bridge)
* Query performance optimisation (cost-based planning, modality pushdown)
* Query language evolution (new syntax, new operators)

==== Test and Quality Engineer (1 person)

*Justification:* The test suite (662 tests) needs to scale with the codebase.
Property-based testing, fuzzing, and integration testing across federation
targets require dedicated attention.

*Responsibilities:*

* Property-based test development (QuickCheck patterns for Rust + Elixir)
* Fuzz testing (VQL parser, drift detection algorithm)
* Integration testing (federation connectors, container deployment)
* Performance benchmarking (automated regression detection)

=== Support (1 person)

==== Support Engineer

*Justification:* Enterprise pilot customers (Phase 2) require responsive
support. The 48-hour response SLA cannot be maintained by the engineering team
while also developing features.

*Responsibilities:*

* Triage and respond to customer support requests
* Reproduce and document bugs from customer environments
* Create knowledge base articles from recurring issues
* Escalate complex issues to engineering with reproduction steps

*Skills required:*

* Database administration experience
* Comfortable with Rust and Elixir at a reading level
* Strong written communication
* Experience with support ticketing systems

=== Marketing (1 person, part-time or contract)

==== Content Marketing Lead

*Justification:* Phase 3 (enterprise expansion) requires professional marketing
materials: case studies, ROI calculators, compliance guides, and analyst
briefings. These are distinct from DevRel content and require marketing
expertise.

*Responsibilities:*

* Create enterprise-facing content (case studies, white papers, compliance guides)
* Manage website and landing pages
* Coordinate analyst briefings (Gartner, Forrester, IDC)
* Event marketing (conference booths, sponsorships)

*Note:* This role may be a contractor or part-time hire in Stage 2, becoming
full-time in Stage 3.

== Stage 3: Sustainable Organisation (10-15 People, Months 30-48)

=== Engineering (6-8 People)

The Stage 2 engineering team expands with:

* *Second Rust engineer* -- dedicated to federation connectors and new modality
  backends
* *Security engineer* -- dedicated to security hardening, vulnerability response,
  and compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
* *Infrastructure engineer* -- dedicated to managed service deployment,
  monitoring, and SRE practices

=== Developer Relations (2 People)

* *DevRel Lead* (from Stage 1)
* *Developer Advocate* -- focused on community growth, meetup organising,
  open-source contribution mentorship

=== Support (2 People)

* *Support Engineer* (from Stage 2)
* *Solutions Engineer* -- pre-sales technical support, architecture reviews,
  proof-of-concept deployments for enterprise prospects

=== Marketing (1-2 People)

* *Content Marketing Lead* (from Stage 2, now full-time)
* *Events Coordinator* (0-1 person) -- conference logistics, sponsorship
  management, analyst relations

=== Operations (1-2 People)

* *SRE / Infrastructure Engineer* -- managed service operations, monitoring,
  alerting, incident response
* *Finance and Admin* (0.5-1 person, possibly outsourced) -- invoicing,
  contracts, compliance documentation

== Functional Unit Summary

[cols="2,1,1,1"]
|===
| Function | Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 3

| Engineering | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-8
| Developer Relations | 1 | 1 | 2
| Support | 0 | 1 | 2

== Compensation Framework

Compensation ranges are based on UK/remote market rates for the required skill
levels. VeriSimDB competes for talent against well-funded database startups
(SurrealDB, Qdrant, LanceDB) and established companies (Neo4j, DataStax).

[cols="2,1,3"]
|===
| Role | Range (GBP, annual) | Notes

| Rust Core Engineer | 60,000-90,000 | Senior level required; Rust + database internals is a rare combination
| Elixir/OTP Engineer | 55,000-80,000 | BEAM expertise commands a premium
| Query Engine Engineer | 65,000-95,000 | PL theory + database systems intersection
| DevRel Lead | 50,000-75,000 | Technical writing + speaking + community management
| Support Engineer | 40,000-60,000 | Database admin + communication skills
| Content Marketing | 45,000-65,000 | B2B SaaS marketing experience
|===

Early hires may accept below-market compensation in exchange for equity or
significant open-source contribution credit. However, VeriSimDB should not
rely on below-market compensation as a strategy -- it creates retention risk
and signals unsustainability.

== Hiring Priorities

Hiring order is determined by the bottleneck that most constrains growth at
each stage:

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
| Priority | Role | Bottleneck Addressed

| 1 | DevRel Lead | Founder cannot maintain 48h issue response, write documentation,
create content, AND develop the core engine simultaneously

| 2 | Rust Core Engineer | Federation connector development and query optimisation
are blocked by single-developer bandwidth

| 3 | Elixir/OTP Engineer | Distributed coordination and Hypatia integration
require dedicated OTP expertise

| 4 | Support Engineer | Enterprise pilot customers require responsive support
that engineering should not be distracted by

| 5 | Content Marketing | Enterprise expansion requires professional marketing
materials beyond what DevRel produces
