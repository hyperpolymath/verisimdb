== Core Messages (All Audiences)

=== The One-Line Pitch

[quote]
VeriSimDB is the world's first multimodal database with cross-modal drift
detection and self-normalisation.

=== The Three-Sentence Pitch

[quote]
The same entity -- a customer, a gene, a transaction -- is represented across
5 to 10 different systems: a graph database, a vector index, a document store,
a time-series database. When one representation changes, the others silently
go stale. VeriSimDB detects this cross-modal drift and repairs it automatically,
before downstream systems consume contradictory data.

=== The Six Core Differentiators

1. *Cross-modal drift detection* -- No other database detects when multiple
   representations of the same entity diverge
2. *8-modality octad model* -- Graph, vector, tensor, semantic, document,
   temporal, provenance, and spatial in one entity
3. *Self-normalisation* -- Automatic repair of drifted representations with
   configurable resolution strategies
4. *Proof-carrying queries (VQL-DT)* -- Optional dependent-type verification
   of query correctness using Idris2
5. *Heterogeneous federation* -- Unified querying across PostgreSQL, ArangoDB,
   Elasticsearch, and Neo4j without data migration
6. *Open source (PMPL)* -- Full-featured community edition with no artificial
   restrictions

== Technical Audience (Database Engineers, Backend Developers)

=== Primary Message

[quote]
VeriSimDB introduces a new primitive to database systems: the coherence score.
Every entity has a quantified measure of how consistent its representations are
across all active modalities. This makes cross-modal drift a queryable, trackable,
alertable condition -- not an invisible failure mode.

=== Supporting Points

* *Architecture*: Rust core for storage and drift algorithms, Elixir/OTP for
  fault-tolerant orchestration. The BEAM VM provides supervision trees, hot code
  reloading, and battle-tested concurrency. Rust provides near-C performance with
  memory safety.

* *VQL (Verisimilitude Query Language)*: Purpose-built query language for
  cross-modal operations. Familiar to SQL users but supports modality-specific
  operations (graph traversals, vector similarity, tensor ops, temporal
  time-travel, spatial containment) in a unified syntax.

* *VQL-DT*: Optional dependent-type layer using Idris2. Proves query type
  correctness, semantic compatibility of cross-modal joins, and threshold
  validity at compile time. Entirely opt-in -- plain VQL works without it.

* *Federation*: Connectors translate between VQL and native query languages
  (SQL, Cypher, AQL, Query DSL). Each connector independently tested with
  fallback to local-only mode. No vendor lock-in.

* *ABI/FFI*: Idris2 for ABI definitions with dependent-type proofs, Zig for
  C-compatible FFI bindings. Generated C headers bridge the two. This is the
  hyperpolymath standard for all projects, not VeriSimDB-specific.

=== Proof Points

* 662 tests (510 Rust + 152 Elixir), 0 failures
* Drift detection algorithm: cosine distance between modality embeddings with
  adaptive thresholds
* No C/C++ build dependencies (Oxigraph feature-flagged off; redb pure-Rust
  graph backend is default)
* Container images build with zero external toolchain requirements
* SLSA provenance and SBOM generation in CI/CD pipeline

=== Use These Phrases

* "Coherence score" (not "consistency check" -- it is continuous, not binary)
* "Cross-modal drift" (not "data inconsistency" -- drift implies gradual
  divergence, which is more accurate than sudden failure)
* "Self-normalisation" (not "auto-repair" -- normalisation implies bringing
  representations into agreement, not fixing broken data)
* "Octad" (not "8 modalities" -- the octad is a unified model, not a feature list)
* "Proof-carrying queries" (not "type-checked queries" -- proofs travel with the
  query result, not just the query)

=== Avoid These Phrases

* "Better than Neo4j/Pinecone/Weaviate" -- VeriSimDB occupies a different category,
  not a better version of the same category
* "Replaces your database" -- VeriSimDB sits alongside existing databases
  (federation) or operates standalone; it does not replace PostgreSQL
* "AI-native database" -- VeriSimDB serves AI workloads (GraphRAG) but is not
  limited to AI; the core value is data consistency
* "NoSQL" -- VeriSimDB has its own query language (VQL); calling it NoSQL implies
  it competes with document stores

== Business Audience (CTOs, VP Engineering, Data Leaders)

=== Primary Message

[quote]
Gartner estimates that poor data quality costs enterprises $12.9 million per year.
The root cause is not dirty data at entry -- it is cross-system inconsistency.
The same entity represented differently across 5-10 systems, with no mechanism to
detect when those representations disagree. VeriSimDB detects this divergence
continuously and repairs it automatically.

=== Supporting Points

* *ROI*: Cross-system inconsistency is the single largest driver of data quality
  costs. Existing solutions (ETL, CDC, MDM) are reactive and partial. VeriSimDB
  is proactive and comprehensive -- it monitors all representations of every entity
  and catches drift before it reaches downstream consumers.

* *Risk reduction*: In regulated industries (financial services, healthcare,
  pharmaceuticals), cross-system inconsistency creates compliance risk. VeriSimDB's
  proof certificates provide auditable evidence of query correctness and data
  consistency.

* *No rip-and-replace*: Federation mode brings drift detection to existing
  infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, ArangoDB, Elasticsearch) without data
  migration. The value is additive -- VeriSimDB sits on top of what you already
  have.

* *Open core model*: The community edition is full-featured with no artificial
  restrictions. Commercial support licenses provide SLAs, priority patches, and
  deployment consulting. No bait-and-switch.

* *Team size*: VeriSimDB is designed to be operated by existing data teams. It
  does not require a dedicated "VeriSimDB team" -- it integrates into existing
  data platform practices.

=== Proof Points

* Open source under PMPL (permissive licence, MPL-2.0 fallback available)
* Enterprise support target ACV: $40,000/year
* Built on battle-tested foundations: Rust (memory safety), Elixir/OTP
  (fault tolerance, 99.9999% uptime heritage from telecom)

=== Use These Phrases

* "Data quality infrastructure" (not "database" -- CTOs hear "database" and think
  "another system to manage")
* "Cross-system consistency" (not "drift detection" -- "drift" requires explanation;
  "consistency" is immediately understood)
* "Proactive detection" (not "monitoring" -- monitoring implies dashboards;
  proactive detection implies the system acts before humans notice)
* "Open core" (not "freemium" -- open core is a respected OSS business model;
  freemium has negative connotations)

=== Avoid These Phrases

* "8 modalities" or "octad" -- too technical for a business audience on first
  hearing; lead with the problem (cross-system inconsistency), not the solution
  architecture
* "Dependent types" or "Idris2" -- these are implementation details that add
  confusion in a business conversation; use "mathematically proven query
  correctness" if the topic comes up
* "Replacing your data infrastructure" -- CTOs will immediately push back;
  VeriSimDB augments, not replaces

== Academic Audience (Researchers, Conference Attendees)

=== Primary Message

[quote]
VeriSimDB formalises the concept of cross-modal drift in multimodal data systems
and provides an operational system for detecting, quantifying, and repairing
representational divergence across 8 data modalities. The query language includes
an optional dependent-type verification layer (VQL-DT) that provides compile-time
proofs of query correctness.

=== Supporting Points

* *Novel contribution*: The coherence score -- a continuous, quantified measure of
  cross-modal consistency -- is a new primitive in database theory. Existing
  multi-model databases store multiple models but do not track inter-model
  consistency.

* *Formal semantics*: VQL has published formal semantics (denotational and
  operational). VQL-DT extends these with dependent-type judgements formalised in
  Idris2, providing machine-checkable proofs of query properties.

* *Reproducibility*: The entire system is open source. Experiments can be
  reproduced. The drift detection algorithm (cosine distance between modality
  embeddings with adaptive thresholds) is fully documented.

* *Cross-disciplinary relevance*: The octad model and drift detection have
  applications in bioinformatics (multi-omics consistency), digital twins
  (simulation-physical divergence), knowledge graph quality assurance (ontological
  consistency), and climate science (cross-sensor calibration).

* *Related work*: Builds on multi-model database theory (Lu & Holubova 2019),
  data quality measurement (Batini et al. 2009), and dependent-type verification
  (Brady 2013). Extends these with cross-modal drift as a first-class concept.

=== Proof Points

* Published technical report: "Cross-Modal Drift Detection and Self-Normalisation
  in Heterogeneous Database Federations"
* Case study: IDApTIK game level architecture with Idris2 dependent-type proofs
* 14-module ABI with 5 cross-domain proofs, zero `believe_me` usage
* Formal VQL grammar (EBNF) and type system specification

=== Venues

* VLDB (Very Large Data Bases) -- core database systems venue
* SIGMOD (ACM Special Interest Group on Management of Data)
* ICDE (IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering)
* EDBT (Extending Database Technology) -- European venue
* CIDR (Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research) -- systems/vision papers
* POPL / ICFP (dependent types and formal methods angle)
* CIKM (Conference on Information and Knowledge Management) -- knowledge graphs

=== Use These Phrases

* "Cross-modal drift" (the central concept; define it precisely)
* "Coherence score" (the quantified measure; explain the algorithm)
* "Dependent-type verification" (not "formal proofs" alone -- specify the
  mechanism)
* "Octad model" (the 8-modality framework; relate to existing multi-model
  taxonomy)

=== Avoid These Phrases

* "World's first" -- academic audiences are sceptical of superlatives; lead with
  the contribution, not the claim
* "Enterprise-grade" -- irrelevant in an academic context
* "$12.9 million" -- Gartner statistics are marketing, not research evidence

== Open Source Community

=== Primary Message

[quote]
VeriSimDB is a full-featured multimodal database released under a permissive
open-source licence (PMPL-1.0-or-later, with MPL-2.0 fallback). All 8
modalities, drift detection, self-normalisation, VQL, and federation are in the
community edition. There is no "enterprise edition" that gates features.

=== Supporting Points

* *No bait-and-switch*: The commercial licence provides operational support (SLA,
  priority patches, consulting), not additional features. Everything ships in the
  open-source release.

* *Contribution-friendly*: Multiple entry points for contributors -- Rust (core
  engine), Elixir (orchestration), ReScript (registry), documentation, testing.
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` with clear guidelines.

* *Principled licensing*: PMPL-1.0-or-later is permissive. MPL-2.0 fallback for
  ecosystems requiring OSI-approved licences. Third-party dependencies retain
  their original licences.

* *Part of a larger ecosystem*: VeriSimDB is one of 265+ hyperpolymath
  repositories. It integrates with QuandleDB (dependent-type graph database),
  LithoGlyph (provenance database), PanLL (unified mission control), and the
  gitbot-fleet (automated repository maintenance).

* *Tech stack choices*: Rust + Elixir is a deliberate architectural choice, not
  an accident. Rust for performance-critical paths, Elixir/OTP for fault-tolerant
  distributed coordination. No Python, no Go, no Node.js.

=== Proof Points

* Repository: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/verisimdb
* 662 tests, 0 failures
* CI/CD with SLSA provenance and SBOM generation
* Containerfile for Podman/Docker deployment
* Comprehensive documentation (40+ `.adoc` files)

=== Community Channels

* Elixir community (ElixirForum, Elixir Slack) -- OTP orchestration layer
* Rust community (r/rust, Rust Users Forum) -- core engine, storage
* BEAM community (Erlang/Elixir conferences, Code BEAM) -- fault tolerance
* Database community (r/database, HN, Lobsters) -- novel architecture
* Formal methods community (Idris2 Discourse, TYPES mailing list) -- VQL-DT

=== Use These Phrases

* "Full-featured community edition" (emphasise no feature gating)
* "Permissive licence" (PMPL is permissive; say so explicitly)
* "Contributions welcome in [Rust/Elixir/ReScript/docs]" (specific, not generic)

=== Avoid These Phrases

* "We" (until there is a team; "the project" or "VeriSimDB" is more honest for
  a single-developer project)
* "Production-ready" (the project is in alpha; be honest about maturity)
* "Enterprise" (the OSS community is not the enterprise audience; lead with
  technical merit)

== Message Consistency Checklist

Before any public communication, verify:

[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Check | Requirement

| Drift definition
| Cross-modal drift is defined as divergence between representations of the *same
entity* across modalities -- not divergence within a single modality

| Octad completeness
| All 8 modalities are listed correctly: graph, vector, tensor, semantic,
document, temporal, provenance, spatial (in that order)

| Competitor framing
| Competitors are positioned as "different category," not "inferior product."
VeriSimDB is a new category (cross-modal consistency infrastructure), not a
better version of an existing category

| Maturity honesty
| Current status is alpha. 662 tests pass. Production deployment requires
additional hardening. Do not oversell readiness.

| Licence accuracy
| PMPL-1.0-or-later (primary). MPL-2.0 (fallback where required). Not AGPL.
Not MIT. Not Apache.

| Author attribution
| Jonathan D.A. Jewell. The Open University, UK. hyperpolymath.
Not "the VeriSimDB team" (single developer).
