== FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

=== VeriSimDB: World's First Multimodal Database with Cross-Modal Drift Detection Launches as Open Source

_New database category addresses the $12.9M annual cost of data inconsistency
by detecting and repairing divergent data representations automatically_

*[City, Date]* -- hyperpolymath today announced the open-source release of
*VeriSimDB*, the world's first multimodal database with cross-modal drift
detection and self-normalisation. VeriSimDB stores entities across 8 simultaneous
data representations -- graph, vector, tensor, semantic, document, temporal,
provenance, and spatial -- and continuously monitors whether those representations
are consistent with each other.

Unlike existing databases that store data in a single modality (Neo4j for graphs,
Pinecone for vectors) or multiple models without consistency checking (ArangoDB,
SurrealDB), VeriSimDB introduces *coherence scoring*: a quantified measure of
cross-modal consistency for every entity. When an entity's representations
diverge -- a condition called "drift" -- VeriSimDB detects the divergence and can
automatically reconcile the data through configurable self-normalisation
strategies.

"Every enterprise I have spoken with has the same problem: the same customer,
product, or transaction is represented differently across five or ten systems, and
nobody knows when those representations disagree," said *Jonathan D.A. Jewell*,
creator of VeriSimDB and researcher at The Open University. "Gartner estimates
this costs organisations $12.9 million per year. VeriSimDB is the first database
designed from the ground up to detect and repair this kind of inconsistency."

=== Technical Foundation

VeriSimDB is built on a *Rust core* for performance and memory safety, with
*Elixir/OTP orchestration* for fault-tolerant concurrency. The database includes
VQL (Verisimilitude Query Language), a purpose-built query language for
cross-modal operations, and an optional dependent-type layer (VQL-DT) that
provides compile-time proofs of query correctness using Idris2.

The project's engineering maturity is demonstrated by a test suite of *662 tests*
(510 Rust + 152 Elixir) with *0 failures*, comprehensive documentation
including formal semantics, and a CI/CD pipeline with SLSA provenance and SBOM
generation.

VeriSimDB also supports *federation* across heterogeneous database backends
including PostgreSQL, ArangoDB, and Elasticsearch, allowing organisations to
bring drift detection to their existing data infrastructure without requiring
data migration.

=== Availability and Licensing

VeriSimDB is available immediately as open source under the *Palimpsest License
(PMPL-1.0-or-later)*, a permissive open-source license. The community edition
is full-featured with no artificial restrictions. Commercial support licenses
with enterprise SLAs, priority security patches, and deployment consulting are
available for organisations that require operational guarantees.

The source code, documentation, and getting-started guide are available at:

=== Target Use Cases

VeriSimDB addresses data consistency challenges across multiple domains:

* *GraphRAG / AI Knowledge Graphs:* Detect when vector embeddings drift from
  knowledge graph state, preventing LLM hallucinations
* *Biomedical Research:* Ensure clinical records, trial timelines, and
  provenance chains remain consistent for regulatory compliance
* *Financial Services:* Real-time cross-system consistency for AML/KYC
  compliance and fraud detection
* *Supply Chain:* End-to-end traceability with automatic detection of expired
  certifications and routing inconsistencies
* *Cybersecurity:* Maintain consistent threat intelligence across graph, vector,
  and document representations

=== About hyperpolymath

hyperpolymath is an open-source software organisation led by Jonathan D.A. Jewell,
a researcher at The Open University (UK). The hyperpolymath ecosystem comprises
265+ repositories spanning databases, programming languages, developer tools,
formal verification, and AI infrastructure. VeriSimDB is part of the
hyperpolymath next-generation database portfolio, which also includes QuandleDB
(dependent-type graph database) and LithoGlyph (provenance database).
