[abstract]
This document describes seven target domains where VeriSimDB's unique
cross-modal drift detection and multimodal storage capabilities address
critical, currently unsolved data infrastructure challenges. Each use case
includes the domain context, the specific problem, how VeriSimDB solves it,
example queries, and the business value.

== Use Case 1: GraphRAG / AI Knowledge Graphs

=== Domain Context

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant context from external knowledge bases before generating
responses. *GraphRAG* extends this by using knowledge graphs rather than flat
document chunks, enabling structured reasoning over entity relationships.

GraphRAG systems typically maintain:

* A *knowledge graph* (entities and relationships)
* *Vector embeddings* of entity descriptions and document chunks
* *Source documents* from which the graph was extracted
* *Temporal metadata* tracking when entities were extracted or updated

=== The Problem

GraphRAG systems suffer from a critical but invisible failure mode: *embedding
drift*. When the knowledge graph is updated (new entities, changed relationships),
the vector embeddings computed from the old graph state are not re-computed. The
graph says one thing; the vectors say another. LLM retrieval uses the stale
embeddings, producing answers that contradict the current graph state.

No existing GraphRAG framework detects this. Developers discover the problem only
when an end user reports a hallucinated or contradictory response.

=== How VeriSimDB Solves It

VeriSimDB stores knowledge graph entities with their graph relationships, vector
embeddings, source documents, and temporal metadata as a single octad entity. When
a graph relationship changes, VeriSimDB's drift detection engine flags that the
vector embedding's coherence score has dropped below the configured threshold.

The system can then:

* *Alert* the GraphRAG pipeline to re-embed the affected entities
* *Quarantine* the drifted entities so they are excluded from retrieval until
  re-embedded
* *Self-normalise* by triggering an automatic re-embedding pipeline

=== Example VQL Query

[source]
----
-- Find entities where graph and vector representations have drifted
SELECT entity.id, entity.graph.relationships, coherence(graph, vector)
FROM knowledge_base
WHERE coherence(graph, vector) < 0.85
ORDER BY coherence(graph, vector) ASC
LIMIT 100
----

=== Business Value

* *Eliminate silent hallucinations* caused by stale embeddings
* *Reduce manual debugging time* for GraphRAG pipeline engineers
* *Increase retrieval accuracy* by ensuring graph-vector consistency
* *Enable real-time GraphRAG updates* with confidence that embeddings are current

== Use Case 2: Biomedical Research Data

=== Domain Context

Biomedical research generates data across many modalities: patient records
(documents), drug interaction networks (graphs), genomic feature tensors, spatial
pathology images, temporal clinical trial timelines, and provenance chains
tracking data from sample collection through analysis to publication.

Regulatory requirements (FDA 21 CFR Part 11, EU MDR, GDPR) mandate complete
traceability and data integrity. A single inconsistency between a clinical trial
result and its provenance chain can trigger a regulatory audit.

=== The Problem

Biomedical data integration is currently achieved through bespoke ETL pipelines
that move data between specialised databases (Neo4j for drug interactions,
PostgreSQL for clinical records, image databases for pathology, etc.). These
pipelines are brittle, slow, and have no mechanism to verify that a patient
entity's graph representation (drug interactions) is consistent with their
document representation (clinical notes) or their temporal representation (trial
timeline).

When a clinical trial protocol amendment changes a patient's treatment, the graph,
document, and timeline representations must all be updated. If the graph update
succeeds but the document update fails, the patient's record is inconsistent, and
no system detects this until a manual audit.

=== How VeriSimDB Solves It

VeriSimDB stores each biomedical entity (patient, drug, gene, trial) with all its
representations in a single octad. Drift detection continuously monitors
consistency across modalities. When a protocol amendment updates one representation,
VeriSimDB verifies that all other representations are updated within the configured
consistency window.

The provenance modality provides an immutable audit trail of every change, who made
it, and from what source -- satisfying regulatory traceability requirements.

=== Example VQL Query

[source]
----
-- Find patients whose clinical notes disagree with their trial timeline
SELECT patient.id,
       coherence(document, temporal) AS doc_time_coherence,
       provenance.last_update
FROM clinical_trial
WHERE trial.id = "NCT-2026-0042"
  AND coherence(document, temporal) < 0.95
----

=== Business Value

* *Regulatory compliance:* Continuous consistency monitoring satisfies FDA/EU MDR
  data integrity requirements without manual audits
* *Patient safety:* Prevent treatment decisions based on inconsistent records
* *Audit readiness:* Provenance modality provides complete, immutable lineage
* *Reduced integration cost:* Replace bespoke ETL pipelines with federated
  drift detection

== Use Case 3: Financial Risk and Compliance

=== Domain Context

Financial institutions maintain customer and transaction data across dozens of
systems: core banking (relational), fraud detection (graph), risk scoring
(vector/ML), regulatory reporting (documents), transaction history (temporal),
and geographic compliance (spatial -- sanctions, jurisdiction).

Regulations including Basel III, MiFID II, AML directives, and KYC requirements
demand that customer data be consistent across all systems at all times. A
customer's risk score in the ML system must agree with their transaction graph in
the fraud detection system and their geographic profile in the compliance system.

=== The Problem

Financial data inconsistency creates two categories of risk:

1. *Regulatory risk:* If a customer's risk classification differs between the AML
   system and the core banking system, regulators may impose fines for inadequate
   controls. Fines for AML violations have exceeded $10 billion globally since 2020.

2. *Operational risk:* If a customer's transaction graph shows suspicious activity
   but their risk score has not been updated, fraud goes undetected. Conversely, if
   the risk score is elevated but the graph is stale, legitimate customers are
   blocked.

Current solutions rely on periodic batch reconciliation (nightly or weekly), which
means inconsistencies persist for hours or days.

=== How VeriSimDB Solves It

VeriSimDB stores each customer entity with graph (relationships, transaction
networks), vector (risk embeddings), document (KYC records), temporal (transaction
history), provenance (data lineage for audit), and spatial (jurisdiction, sanctions
geography) representations. Drift detection runs in real time, flagging any
customer whose representations disagree.

Federation allows VeriSimDB to connect to the existing core banking, fraud
detection, and compliance systems, bringing cross-modal consistency checking to
current infrastructure without data migration.

=== Example VQL Query

[source]
----
-- Find customers with inconsistent risk profiles across modalities
SELECT customer.id,
       coherence(vector, graph) AS risk_graph_coherence,
       coherence(document, spatial) AS kyc_geo_coherence,
       temporal.last_transaction,
       provenance.source_systems
FROM customers
WHERE coherence(vector, graph) < 0.90
   OR coherence(document, spatial) < 0.90
ORDER BY LEAST(coherence(vector, graph), coherence(document, spatial)) ASC
----

=== Business Value

* *Regulatory compliance:* Real-time cross-system consistency satisfies AML/KYC
  requirements with auditable coherence scores
* *Fraud detection:* Eliminate the window between graph update and risk score
  update where fraud can go undetected
* *Reduced fines:* Continuous monitoring vs. periodic batch reconciliation
  demonstrates "reasonable controls" to regulators
* *Audit efficiency:* Provenance modality provides complete lineage for every
  customer data element

== Use Case 4: Supply Chain Traceability

=== Domain Context

Modern supply chains involve hundreds of entities (suppliers, manufacturers,
distributors, retailers) connected by complex logistics networks. Regulations
including the EU Digital Product Passport, the US FSMA (Food Safety Modernization
Act), and ESG reporting requirements demand end-to-end traceability.

Supply chain data is inherently multimodal:

* *Graph:* Supplier-manufacturer-distributor relationships
* *Document:* Purchase orders, invoices, certificates of origin
* *Temporal:* Shipment timelines, temperature logs, shelf-life tracking
* *Spatial:* Geographic location of goods in transit
* *Provenance:* Chain of custody, certifications, audits

=== The Problem

Supply chain transparency initiatives fail because the data is fragmented across
disconnected systems. A manufacturer's certificate of origin (document) may list
materials from a compliant supplier, but the supplier relationship graph has not
been updated to reflect that the supplier's certification expired. The geographic
tracking shows goods in transit through a sanctioned region, but the compliance
document still shows the old routing.

These inconsistencies are invisible until a physical audit, a product recall, or
a regulatory investigation.

=== How VeriSimDB Solves It

VeriSimDB's octad model stores each supply chain entity (product, shipment,
supplier) with all its representations. When a supplier's certification expires,
the document modality is updated, and drift detection immediately flags that the
graph modality (which still shows the supplier as "certified") is inconsistent.

The spatial modality tracks goods in real time and cross-checks against compliance
documents. The temporal modality provides a complete timeline of every change. The
provenance modality establishes an immutable chain of custody.

=== Example VQL Query

[source]
----
-- Find products whose supplier certifications have drifted
SELECT product.id,
       graph.supplier,
       document.certification_status,
       coherence(graph, document) AS cert_coherence,
       spatial.current_location,
       temporal.last_audit
FROM supply_chain
WHERE coherence(graph, document) < 0.90
  AND temporal.last_audit < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
----

=== Business Value

* *Regulatory compliance:* Continuous traceability for EU Digital Product Passport,
  FSMA, ESG reporting
* *Risk reduction:* Detect expired certifications, non-compliant routing, and
  chain-of-custody gaps before they cause product recalls
* *Audit efficiency:* Provenance modality eliminates manual chain-of-custody
  reconstruction
* *Consumer trust:* Verified, consistent supply chain data for end-to-end
  transparency

== Use Case 5: Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage

=== Domain Context

Cultural heritage institutions (museums, archives, libraries) manage collections
of artefacts that are described across multiple modalities:

* *Graph:* Relationships between artefacts, creators, historical periods, and
  exhibition histories
* *Document:* Catalogue records, conservation reports, scholarly annotations
* *Semantic:* Ontological classification (e.g., CIDOC-CRM, Dublin Core)
* *Temporal:* Provenance timelines (creation, ownership history, exhibition dates)
* *Spatial:* Geographic origin, current location, excavation site coordinates
* *Vector:* Image embeddings for visual similarity search
* *Provenance:* Acquisition history, legal ownership chain

=== The Problem

Cultural heritage data is notoriously inconsistent. A catalogue record (document)
may describe an artefact as "Roman, 2nd century CE" while the ontological
classification (semantic) says "Hellenistic" and the temporal timeline shows a
creation date in the 3rd century BCE. These inconsistencies arise from decades of
cataloguing by different scholars with different conventions, and no system
detects them.

Digital humanities researchers spend enormous amounts of time manually
reconciling conflicting descriptions across catalogues, ontologies, and timelines
before they can begin analysis.

=== How VeriSimDB Solves It

VeriSimDB stores each artefact with all its modalities in a single octad entity.
Drift detection flags inconsistencies between catalogue records and ontological
classifications, between temporal timelines and scholarly annotations, and between
image embeddings and textual descriptions.

Federation allows VeriSimDB to connect to existing collection management systems
(MuseumPlus, TMS, ArchivesSpace) and bring cross-modal consistency checking to
existing catalogues without requiring data migration.

=== Example VQL Query

[source]
----
-- Find artefacts with inconsistent date attributions across modalities
SELECT artefact.id,
       document.period_attribution,
       semantic.ontology_class,
       temporal.creation_date,
       coherence(document, semantic, temporal) AS date_coherence
FROM collection
WHERE coherence(document, semantic, temporal) < 0.80
ORDER BY date_coherence ASC
----

=== Business Value

* *Research efficiency:* Eliminate manual reconciliation of conflicting catalogue
  records, freeing researchers for analysis
* *Data quality:* Systematically identify and resolve decades of cataloguing
  inconsistencies
* *Cross-institutional collaboration:* Federation enables consistency checking
  across multiple institutions' collections
* *Grant competitiveness:* Demonstrable data quality infrastructure strengthens
  research grant applications

== Use Case 6: Scientific Data Management

=== Domain Context

Scientific research produces multimodal datasets: experimental measurements
(tensors), instrument metadata (documents), collaboration networks (graphs),
publication timelines (temporal), methodological lineage (provenance), and
geographic data (field sites, observatories).

Reproducibility is the cornerstone of the scientific method, yet the
"reproducibility crisis" affects 52% of scientific fields (Baker, Nature 2016).
A significant contributor is data inconsistency between published results and
underlying datasets.

=== The Problem

A published paper (document) reports results derived from a dataset (tensor).
When the dataset is corrected (e.g., an instrument calibration error is
discovered), the tensor is updated, but the published paper is not retracted or
amended. The methodology provenance chain shows the old calibration, but the
instrument metadata document now shows the corrected calibration. These
representations have drifted, and no system detects it.

Similarly, when a collaboration network changes (a co-author retracts their
contribution), the graph representation must be updated, but the document
(published paper) and provenance (author contribution records) may not be.

=== How VeriSimDB Solves It

VeriSimDB stores each scientific entity (dataset, publication, experiment,
researcher) with all its modalities. When a dataset is corrected, drift detection
flags that the published paper's document representation is now inconsistent with
the tensor (corrected data) and provenance (updated methodology).

This does not automatically retract papers -- it surfaces the inconsistency so
that researchers, journal editors, and data stewards can take appropriate action.

=== Example VQL Query

[source]
----
-- Find publications whose cited datasets have been corrected
SELECT publication.doi,
       tensor.dataset_version,
       provenance.calibration_date,
       coherence(document, tensor, provenance) AS data_coherence
FROM research_outputs
WHERE coherence(document, tensor, provenance) < 0.90
  AND tensor.dataset_version > document.cited_version
----

=== Business Value

* *Reproducibility:* Systematically detect when published results no longer match
  their underlying data
* *Research integrity:* Provenance modality provides complete methodological
  lineage
* *Data management compliance:* Satisfies FAIR data principles (Findable,
  Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) with cross-modal consistency
* *Institutional reputation:* Proactive detection of data inconsistencies before
  external challenges

== Use Case 7: Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence

=== Domain Context

Cybersecurity threat intelligence (CTI) involves aggregating and correlating
indicators of compromise (IoCs), threat actor profiles, attack patterns, and
vulnerability data from multiple sources. This data is inherently multimodal:

* *Graph:* Threat actor relationships, attack infrastructure networks, malware
  family trees
* *Vector:* Similarity embeddings for malware samples, phishing emails, network
  traffic patterns
* *Document:* Threat reports, vulnerability advisories (CVEs), incident reports
* *Temporal:* Attack timelines, vulnerability disclosure dates, patch release
  schedules
* *Provenance:* Intelligence source attribution, confidence levels, corroboration
  chains
* *Spatial:* Geographic attribution, IP geolocation, infrastructure mapping

=== The Problem

CTI platforms aggregate intelligence from dozens of feeds (MITRE ATT&CK, STIX/TAXII,
open-source feeds, commercial feeds, internal detections). The same threat actor or
malware family may be described differently across sources. When one feed updates
a threat actor's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), the graph is updated,
but the vector embeddings (used for similarity matching) still reflect the old
behaviour profile. Temporal timelines may show campaign activity that contradicts
the current graph state.

These inconsistencies cause false negatives (real threats are missed because
embeddings are stale) and false positives (old indicators trigger alerts for
threats that have evolved).

=== How VeriSimDB Solves It

VeriSimDB stores each CTI entity (threat actor, malware, vulnerability, campaign)
with all its modalities. When a STIX feed updates a threat actor's TTPs, drift
detection flags that the vector embeddings and document representations have not
been updated to reflect the new behaviour.

Federation allows VeriSimDB to connect to existing SIEM, SOAR, and TIP platforms,
bringing cross-modal consistency to current CTI infrastructure.

=== Example VQL Query

[source]
----
-- Find threat actors whose behaviour profiles have drifted across sources
SELECT actor.id,
       graph.ttp_count,
       vector.similarity_cluster,
       temporal.last_campaign,
       coherence(graph, vector, document) AS intel_coherence,
       provenance.source_feeds
FROM threat_actors
WHERE coherence(graph, vector, document) < 0.85
  AND temporal.last_campaign > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY intel_coherence ASC
----

=== Business Value

* *Reduced false negatives:* Ensure detection rules are based on current, consistent
  threat intelligence
* *Reduced false positives:* Stale indicators are flagged and updated, reducing
  alert fatigue
* *Source correlation:* Provenance modality tracks which feeds contributed to each
  intelligence element and whether they agree
* *Audit trail:* Complete lineage of every intelligence assessment for incident
  response and post-mortem analysis

All seven domains share the same fundamental problem: *data exists in multiple
representations that inevitably diverge, and no existing system detects the
divergence*. VeriSimDB's cross-modal drift detection addresses this root cause
across every domain where multimodal data consistency matters.
