== What Is VeriSimDB?

*The world's first multimodal database with cross-modal drift detection and
self-normalisation.* VeriSimDB stores every entity across 8 simultaneous
representations and automatically detects when those representations diverge.

== The Problem

Data lives in silos. The same customer, product, or transaction exists as a graph
node, a vector embedding, a JSON document, a relational row, and a temporal
snapshot -- all in different systems. When one representation changes, the others
go stale. *Nobody notices until the damage is done.*

Poor data quality costs enterprises *$12.9 million per year* (Gartner). The root
cause is not dirty data at entry -- it is *cross-system inconsistency*. No existing
database tracks whether multiple representations of the same entity agree with
each other.

== The Solution

VeriSimDB introduces the *octad model* -- 8 modalities per entity, with continuous
cross-modal consistency monitoring.

=== Key Features

* *8-modality storage* -- Graph, Vector, Tensor, Semantic, Document, Temporal,
  Provenance, and Spatial representations in a single database
* *Cross-modal drift detection* -- Continuous coherence scoring detects when
  representations diverge, before downstream systems consume inconsistent data
* *Self-normalisation* -- Automatic reconciliation of drifted data using
  configurable resolution strategies (alert, quarantine, or repair)
* *VQL query language* -- Purpose-built query language for cross-modal operations
  with optional dependent-type proofs (VQL-DT) for compile-time query verification
* *Federation* -- Bring drift detection to existing infrastructure by federating
  across PostgreSQL, ArangoDB, Elasticsearch, Neo4j, and more
* *Open source* -- Full-featured community edition under the Palimpsest License
  (PMPL-1.0-or-later); no feature gating

=== Technical Differentiators

* *Only database with cross-modal drift detection* -- No competitor (Neo4j,
  Pinecone, Weaviate, ArangoDB, SurrealDB) tracks cross-modal consistency
* *Formally verified queries* -- VQL-DT provides dependent-type proofs of query
  correctness, catching type errors and semantic mismatches before execution
* *Production-grade engineering* -- Rust core + Elixir/OTP orchestration; 662 tests
  (510 Rust + 152 Elixir), 0 failures; built for performance and fault tolerance
