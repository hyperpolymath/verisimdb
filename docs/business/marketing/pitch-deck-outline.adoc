VeriSimDB
The World's First Multimodal Database with
Cross-Modal Drift Detection

=== Speaker Notes

Open with the tagline. VeriSimDB is not another database -- it is a new category
of data infrastructure. The word "verisimilitude" means "the appearance of being
true" -- VeriSimDB ensures that all representations of your data maintain
verisimilitude with reality and with each other.

== Slide 2: The Problem

=== Content

*Data Inconsistency Costs Enterprises $12.9 Million Per Year*

The same entity exists in 5+ systems. When one changes, the others go stale.

----
Customer "Jane Doe"
  ├── Graph DB:    Connected to 47 accounts     ← Updated yesterday
  ├── Vector DB:   Embedding [0.23, 0.87, ...]  ← Computed 3 months ago
  ├── Document DB: { "address": "123 Old St" }  ← Never updated
  ├── RDBMS:       Row #4821, address = "456 New Ave" ← Updated today
  └── Audit Trail: Last change: ???              ← Gap in history
----

*Nobody detects this. Nobody repairs it. Downstream systems consume stale data.*

=== Key Statistics

* *$12.9M/year* -- Average cost of poor data quality per organisation (Gartner)
* *80%* -- Time data workers spend on cleaning vs. analysis (McKinsey)
* *35%* -- Enterprises citing data quality as primary barrier to AI adoption (IBM)

=== Speaker Notes

Walk through the "Jane Doe" example. Point out that each system is individually
correct -- the graph relationships are valid, the vector embedding is
mathematically sound, the document is well-formed. The problem is that they
disagree with each other. No existing tool detects this disagreement.

== Slide 3: The Solution

=== Content

*VeriSimDB: 8 Modalities, One Coherent Entity*

The *octad model* -- every entity stored across 8 simultaneous representations
with continuous cross-modal consistency monitoring.

----
Entity "Jane Doe" — Coherence Score: 0.94
  ├── Graph:      47 connections           ✓ Consistent
  ├── Vector:     [0.23, 0.87, ...]        ⚠ Drift: 0.12
  ├── Tensor:     Feature matrix updated   ✓ Consistent
  ├── Semantic:   Ontology: Customer       ✓ Consistent
  ├── Document:   { "addr": "456 New" }    ✓ Updated
  ├── Temporal:   Full history, no gaps    ✓ Consistent
  ├── Provenance: Source: CRM → sync       ✓ Traced
  └── Spatial:    Geo: 51.5074° N          ✓ Consistent
----

*When the vector embedding drifts, VeriSimDB detects it and triggers
self-normalisation.*

=== Speaker Notes

Emphasise the coherence score. This is the key innovation -- a quantified measure
of cross-modal consistency that no other database computes. The octad model is not
about storing 8 copies of data; it is about maintaining 8 complementary
representations that together provide a complete picture of each entity.

== Slide 4: How It Works

----

=== Speaker Notes

Three layers: the VQL query engine parses and type-checks queries; the drift
detection engine continuously monitors coherence across modalities; the storage
layer handles the octad per entity. Federation allows VeriSimDB to bring drift
detection to existing databases without data migration. Rust provides performance,
Elixir/OTP provides fault tolerance and concurrency, ReScript provides a type-safe
registry for modality metadata.

== Slide 5: Demo — Drift Detection in Action

=== Content

*Before: Traditional Multi-Model Query*

[source,sql]
----
-- ArangoDB: Get customer graph + document
FOR c IN customers
  FILTER c._key == "jane-doe"
  FOR rel IN OUTBOUND c customer_accounts
    RETURN { customer: c, accounts: rel }

-- Separately: Pinecone vector search
pinecone.query(vector=[0.23, 0.87, ...], top_k=10)

-- No way to know if these agree!
----

*After: VeriSimDB Cross-Modal Query with Drift Detection*

[source]
----
-- VQL: Query across modalities with coherence check
SELECT entity, coherence_score, drifted_modalities
FROM entities
WHERE entity.id = "jane-doe"
  AND modalities IN (graph, vector, document)
  AND coherence_score > 0.90

-- Result:
-- entity: jane-doe
-- coherence_score: 0.82  ⚠ BELOW THRESHOLD
-- drifted_modalities: [vector]
-- action: self-normalise triggered
----

=== Speaker Notes

Walk through both examples. In the "before" scenario, a developer queries two
separate databases and has no way to know if the results are consistent. In the
"after" scenario, VeriSimDB's VQL query spans modalities and includes the
coherence score directly in the result set. When the score drops below the
configured threshold, self-normalisation is triggered automatically. The developer
does not need to write reconciliation logic.

== Slide 6: Technology

=== Content

*Built for Production*

[cols="2,3"]
|===
| Component | Technology

| Core storage + indexing
| *Rust* -- Near-C performance, memory safety without GC

| Orchestration + fault tolerance
| *Elixir/OTP* -- Battle-tested concurrency model (Erlang VM)

| Type-safe registry
| *ReScript* -- ML-family type system compiling to JavaScript

| Query language
| *VQL* -- Purpose-built for cross-modal operations

| Formal verification
| *VQL-DT* -- Dependent-type proofs of query correctness

| ABI definitions
| *Idris2* -- Dependent types for interface verification

| FFI implementation
| *Zig* -- C-compatible, zero-overhead foreign function interface
|===

*Test Suite:* 510 Rust tests + 152 Elixir tests = *662 total, 0 failures*

=== Speaker Notes

Emphasise the engineering quality. Rust + Elixir is an increasingly popular
combination for data infrastructure (used by Discord, Fly.io, and others). The
test suite is comprehensive and runs in CI on every commit. VQL-DT's dependent
types are optional -- teams can start with plain VQL and adopt formal verification
incrementally.

== Slide 7: Market Opportunity

=== Content

*$51M Serviceable Obtainable Market*

[cols="2,1,1,1"]
|===
| Segment | TAM | SAM | SOM

| Data Quality Tools
| $2.3B
| $460M
| $23M

| Graph Databases
| $5.6B
| $280M
| $14M

| Vector Databases
| $1.2B
| $120M
| $6M

| Multimodal Databases
| $800M
| $160M
| $8M

| *Combined*
|
|
| *$51M*
|===

*VeriSimDB creates a new category at the intersection of these markets.*

=== Speaker Notes

The SOM estimates are deliberately conservative (1% of SAM). VeriSimDB sits at
the intersection of four high-growth markets, each expanding at 15-25% CAGR.
The multimodal database segment is nascent -- there is an opportunity to define
the category rather than compete within an established one.

== Slide 8: Business Model

*No feature gating. Revenue from operational value, not artificial restrictions.*

=== Speaker Notes

This model is inspired by successful open-core companies (GitLab, Elastic,
Confluent). The community edition is intentionally full-featured because feature
gating erodes developer trust. Enterprise customers pay for operational value:
SLAs, priority patches, and deployment expertise. This creates a large adoption
funnel and a natural conversion path.

_* = supported_

*VeriSimDB is the only database in any category with cross-modal drift detection.*

=== Speaker Notes

Walk through the matrix column by column. The key insight is not that VeriSimDB
does everything -- it is that VeriSimDB does something no one else does: cross-modal
consistency monitoring. This is not a feature that can be easily added to existing
architectures; it requires the data model to be designed around multi-modal
coherence from the ground up.

== Slide 10: Traction

=== Speaker Notes

VeriSimDB is not a whitepaper or a prototype. The test suite, documentation, and
engineering infrastructure are at a level that most open-source databases do not
reach until much later. The 0-failure test suite across 662 tests demonstrates
engineering discipline. The formal semantics and dependent-type proofs are unique
in the database industry.

=== Speaker Notes

End with a clear call to action. VeriSimDB is not looking for traditional VC
funding at this stage -- it is looking for community, adoption, and partnerships.
The open-core model means the product grows through usage, and commercial revenue
follows adoption naturally.
