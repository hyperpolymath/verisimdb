    "title": "VQL-DT Not Connected to VQL PROOF Runtime",
    "body": "\\n**Location:** `vql-dt/` (Lean type definitions), VQL query router\\n\\n**Current state:** Lean type definitions exist specifying dependent type contracts for all six PROOF types. The VQL parser parses `PROOF` clauses and the executor routes proofs through `verify_single_proof/1` which validates contract existence. However, the Lean type checker itself is not invoked at runtime. VQL-DT queries execute but proof certificates are not formally verified by the Lean checker.\\n\\n**Impact:** PROOF clauses are semantically checked (contract existence, parameter validation) but not formally verified via the Lean dependent type checker. Custom ZKP circuits work (R1CS verification), but the VQL-DT formal path is not wired.\\n\\n**Resolution:** Wire the Lean type checker into the VQL-DT execution path. See link:docs/vql-vs-vql-dt.adoc[VQL Slipstream vs VQL-DT].\\n\\n",
