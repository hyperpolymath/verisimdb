    "body": "\\n**Location:** `rust-core/verisim-api/Cargo.toml`\\n\\n**Resolved:** 2026-02-12. `src/main.rs` now exists with a `main()` function that reads host/port from environment variables (`VERISIM_HOST`/`VERISIM_PORT`) and initializes the HTTP server. `cargo run -p verisim-api` works.\\n\\n**Original issue:** The crate was missing a `src/main.rs` entry point and could not be run as a standalone binary.\\n\\n",
