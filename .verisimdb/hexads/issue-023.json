    "body": "\\n**Location:** `rust-core/verisim-repl/`\\n\\n**Current state:** The REPL crate was added by a linter with rustyline API incompatibilities (`Completer`, `Highlighter`, `Hinter`, `Validator` traits are private in the installed version). The workspace builds successfully with `--exclude verisim-repl`.\\n\\n**Impact:** Low. The REPL is a developer convenience tool, not a core component.\\n\\n**Resolution:** Update rustyline API calls to match installed version, or pin a compatible version.\\n",
