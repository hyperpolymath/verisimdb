    "title": "ReScript Registry 60% Complete",
    "body": "\\n**Location:** `src/registry/Registry.res`, `rescript.json`\\n\\n**Resolved:** 2026-02-13. All 7 previously stubbed functions now have real implementations:\\n\\n- `executeFederatedQuery`: HTTP fan-out to eligible peer stores with trust filtering, response mapping, and result aggregation with limit enforcement.\\n- `achieveConsensus`: Quorum-based consensus with configurable mode (Strong/Quorum/Eventual), concurrent store fetch, agreement calculation.\\n- `replicateHexad`: Fetches hexad from source store via HTTP, pushes to all target stores, reports per-target errors.\\n- `checkReplicationStatus`: Examines mapping locations, checks store liveness against maxStoreDowntimeMs, detects trust divergence as data divergence proxy.\\n- `detectByzantineFaults`: Computes median trust across stores for a hexad, flags stores deviating >0.3 from median.\\n- `serializeRegistry`/`deserializeRegistry`: Full JSON serialization and deserialization of registry state (stores, mappings, config).\\n\\nAdded `rescript.json` for build configuration.\\n\\n",
