    "body": "\\n**Location:** `rust-core/verisim-semantic/src/circuit_registry.rs`, `circuit_compiler.rs`, `verification_keys.rs`, `src/vql/VQLCircuit.res`\\n\\n**Resolved:** 2026-02-13. Full custom circuit infrastructure implemented:\\n\\n- Circuit Registry: named circuit storage with register/get/verify/list/unregister operations\\n- Circuit Compiler: DSL gates (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, LinearCombination) compiled to R1CS constraints\\n- Verification Key Store: per-circuit keys with rotation support and federation export/import\\n- VQL Circuit DSL: ReScript types for circuit definition with `PROOF CUSTOM \"name\" WITH (param=value)`\\n- 25 semantic tests pass covering circuit operations\\n\\n**Original issue:** The `CUSTOM` proof type used a hardcoded circuit configuration with no DSL, compiler, or registry.\\n\\n",
