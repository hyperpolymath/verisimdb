    "title": "VQL WHERE Condition Routing Was Broken",
    "body": "\\n**Location:** `elixir-orchestration/lib/verisim/query/vql_executor.ex`\\n\\n**Resolved:** 2026-02-13. `has_fulltext_condition?/1`, `has_vector_condition?/1`, and `has_graph_pattern?/1` now walk the AST recursively to detect actual condition types. `extract_text_query/1`, `extract_vector_query/1`, and `extract_graph_query/1` now parse actual values from the AST instead of returning hardcoded placeholders. All queries were previously routed to `:multi` type regardless of conditions.\\n\\n**Original issue:** All six condition detection and extraction functions were stubs (returning `false` and hardcoded values), causing every query to be routed as a multi-modal query even when a single modality was targeted.\\n\\n",
