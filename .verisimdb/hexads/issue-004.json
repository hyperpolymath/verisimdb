    "title": "Drift Auto-Trigger Missing",
    "body": "\\n**Location:** Elixir orchestration layer, `VeriSim.DriftMonitor`\\n\\n**Resolved:** 2026-02-12. `DriftMonitor.init/1` now schedules a periodic sweep via `Process.send_after` at a configurable interval (default 60s). The `:sweep` handler performs a full drift sweep including pulling aggregate metrics from the Rust core via `RustClient.drift_status/0`, then reschedules itself. The sweep interval is configurable via the `config` option passed to `start_link`.\\n\\n**Original issue:** Drift detection had to be triggered manually. No scheduled or event-driven trigger existed.\\n\\n",
