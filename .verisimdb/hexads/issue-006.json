    "title": "ZKP / Proven Library Not Integrated",
    "body": "\\n**Location:** `docs/zkp-and-sanctify-integration.adoc` (design), `proven-coherence.md` (notes)\\n\\n**Current state:** The integration of zero-knowledge proofs via the sanctify library is documented as a consultation paper and design specification. The integration is not implemented. No ZKP circuits are generated, no proofs are created, and no verification occurs at runtime.\\n\\n**Impact:** Privacy-preserving proofs (where a query result can be verified without revealing the underlying data) are not available. This affects multi-tenant federation and compliance scenarios where data must remain private but provenance must be verifiable.\\n\\n**Resolution:** Implement sanctify integration after VQL-DT (issue 5) is resolved, since ZKP proof generation depends on the dependent type checking pipeline being functional.\\n\\n",
