    "title": "Atom Table Exhaustion Risk in VQL Bridge",
    "body": "\\n**Location:** `elixir-orchestration/lib/verisim/query/vql_bridge.ex`\\n\\n**Resolved:** 2026-02-13. All 8 `String.to_atom` calls replaced with `safe_to_atom/1` helper that uses an explicit allowlist map for the known atom values (6 modalities + 5 aggregate functions + `all`), falling back to `String.to_existing_atom/1`.\\n\\n**Original issue:** 8 `String.to_atom` calls could theoretically exhaust the BEAM atom table if fed arbitrary input, since the BEAM atom table is finite and atoms are never garbage collected.\\n\\n",
