    "title": "Normalizer Regeneration Strategies Are Stubs",
    "body": "\\n**Location:** `rust-core/verisim-normalizer/`\\n\\n**Resolved:** 2026-02-12. Regeneration strategies now inspect hexad data to select the authoritative modality and derive drifted modality content from it, rather than returning hardcoded placeholder strings. Each of the six modality strategies performs actual data transformation.\\n\\n**Original issue:** Every regeneration strategy returned a hardcoded `[regenerated]` placeholder string instead of actually regenerating data.\\n\\n",
