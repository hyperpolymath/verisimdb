    "body": "\\n**Location:** `elixir-orchestration/lib/verisim/query/vql_executor.ex`, `rust-core/verisim-api/src/federation.rs`\\n\\n**Resolved:** 2026-02-13. Added `GET /hexads` list endpoint with `?limit=N&offset=M` pagination to the Rust API. The `HexadStore` trait now includes a `list(limit, offset)` method. Federation `query_single_peer()` now falls back to the `/hexads` list endpoint when neither text_query nor vector_query is provided, so bare `SELECT * FROM FEDERATION /pattern/*` returns actual hexad data instead of empty results.\\n\\n",
