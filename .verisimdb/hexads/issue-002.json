    "title": "Federation Executor Always Returns Empty",
    "body": "\\n**Location:** Elixir orchestration layer, `VeriSim.FederationExecutor`\\n\\n**Resolved:** 2026-02-12. Federation executor now performs parallel HTTP fanout to registered peers via reqwest, decomposes queries into per-peer sub-queries, dispatches them, and merges results. Uses `Task.async_stream` for concurrent peer dispatch with configurable timeouts.\\n\\n**Original issue:** The federation executor always returned `{:ok, []}` regardless of query content or number of registered peers.\\n\\n",
