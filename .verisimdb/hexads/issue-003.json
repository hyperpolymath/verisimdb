    "title": "Federation Resolver Peer Queries Unimplemented",
    "body": "\\n**Location:** Elixir orchestration layer, `VeriSim.Federation.Resolver`\\n\\n**Resolved:** 2026-02-12. `query_peer/3` now makes real HTTP requests to peer endpoints via `Req` with configurable timeout, parses JSON responses, and returns structured results with source store attribution and response time tracking. Drift policy filtering (strict/repair/tolerate/latest) is implemented.\\n\\n**Original issue:** The `query_peer/3` function returned `{:error, :not_implemented}`. Peers could be registered but never contacted.\\n\\n",
