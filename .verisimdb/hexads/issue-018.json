    "body": "\\n**Location:** `elixir-orchestration/lib/verisim/query/vql_executor.ex`\\n\\n**Resolved:** 2026-02-13. `generate_explain_plan/1` now analyzes the actual query AST to produce cost estimates based on source type, modality count, WHERE clause complexity, cross-modal conditions, GROUP BY presence, and proof obligations. Delegates to the Rust verisim-planner API when available, with local estimation as fallback.\\n\\n**Original issue:** EXPLAIN returned a static plan with hardcoded step names and costs totalling 71ms, regardless of the actual query structure.\\n\\n",
