Criterion benchmarks now cover all 6 modality stores plus cross-modal and drift operations:\\n\\n- **Document:** create_document, search_text (Tantivy full-text, 1000-doc corpus)\\n- **Vector:** insert (128/384/768 dims), search (10k vectors, HNSW)\\n- **Graph:** add_node, add_edge (Oxigraph)\\n- **Tensor:** store_create_64x64, store_get, reduce_sum_axis0 (ndarray)\\n- **Semantic:** register_type, get_type, proof_create_cbor, proof_verify (CBOR + ZKP verification)\\n- **Temporal:** version_create, version_get_by_number, version_get_latest, history_10, history_100\\n- **Hexad:** create_hexad, get_hexad (unified entity)\\n- **Drift:** calculate_drift (semantic vector drift)\\n- **Cross-modal:** vector_similarity_search, fulltext_search (1000 multi-modal hexads)\\n\\n**Original issue:** Only document, vector, graph, hexad, drift, and cross-modal benchmarks existed. Tensor, semantic, and temporal stores had zero benchmarks.\\n\\n",
