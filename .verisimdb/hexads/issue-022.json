    "title": "proven Library Not Integrated",
    "body": "\\n**Location:** Design docs only\\n\\n**Current state:** Custom ZKP circuits work via R1CS constraint systems with in-process verification. However, the `proven` library for generating actual zero-knowledge proofs (where a verifier can confirm a property without seeing the data) is not integrated.\\n\\n**Impact:** Privacy-preserving proofs are not available. Current circuit verification requires the witness (private input) to be present, which defeats the zero-knowledge property.\\n\\n**Resolution:** Integrate proven library after VQL-DT (issue 21) is resolved.\\n\\n",
