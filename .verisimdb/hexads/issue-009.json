    "title": "HNSW Implementation Is Real",
    "body": "\\n**Location:** `rust-core/verisim-vector/src/hnsw.rs`\\n\\n**Current state:** The HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) implementation in `verisim-vector` is a genuine, functional implementation at approximately 670 lines of Rust. A previous audit incorrectly claimed this was brute-force search. This is **not** an issue -- it is a correction of a previous mischaracterization.\\n\\n**Impact:** None (this is a positive clarification). The vector modality store uses a real approximate nearest-neighbor algorithm, not a naive linear scan.\\n\\n**Note:** This entry exists to prevent future audits from repeating the same incorrect claim.\\n\\n",
