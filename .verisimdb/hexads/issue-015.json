    "body": "\\n**Location:** `src/abi/Foreign.idr`, `debugger/src/abi/Foreign.idr`, `practice-mirror/src/abi/Foreign.idr`\\n\\n**Resolved:** 2026-02-13. FFI declarations changed from `Bits64 -> AnyPtr -> PrimIO Bits32` to `Bits64 -> (Bits64 -> Bits32 -> Bits32) -> PrimIO Bits32`, making the callback type match the declaration and eliminating the need for `believe_me` casts. Zero `believe_me` calls remain in the codebase.\\n\\n**Original issue:** `registerCallback` used `believe_me` to cast a callback function to `AnyPtr`, a BANNED unsafe pattern that bypasses the type checker.\\n\\n",
