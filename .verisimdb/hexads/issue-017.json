    "title": "No ETS Caching in RustClient",
    "body": "\\n**Location:** `elixir-orchestration/lib/verisim/rust_client.ex`\\n\\n**Resolved:** 2026-02-13. Added ETS-based read-through cache with configurable TTL (30s default for hexads, 10s for drift scores). Cache is invalidated on writes (update/delete). Provides `init_cache/0`, `clear_cache/0`, and `invalidate_cache/1` for cache management.\\n\\n**Original issue:** Every RustClient call made a fresh HTTP request to the Rust core, with no caching. Repeated reads of the same hexad in a query pipeline (e.g., cross-modal evaluation fetching the same entity multiple times) each incurred full HTTP round-trip latency.\\n\\n",
