= YOUR Template Repo Roadmap

== Current Status

Initial development phase.

== Milestones

=== v0.1.0 - Foundation
* [ ] Core functionality
* [ ] Basic documentation
* [ ] CI/CD pipeline

=== v1.0.0 - Stable Release
* [ ] Full feature set
* [ ] Comprehensive tests
* [ ] Production ready

== Future Directions

_To be determined based on community feedback._

== Enhancements Identified (2026-02-08)

=== Immediate Fixes

* Fix tensor reduction operations (max/min/prod use sum_axis - TODO in code)
* Fix unused variable warnings (verisim-normalizer)
* Implement document search highlighting (TODO in code)
* Add binary target to verisim-api for `cargo run` (currently fails with "a bin target must be available")

=== Integration

* panic-attack result schema: define a hexad schema for storing static analysis results
** Document modality: full JSON report as searchable text
** Graph modality: file -> weakness -> attack-recommendation triples
** Temporal modality: track results over time
** Vector modality: embed weakness descriptions for similarity search
* MCP server mode: expose verisimdb as an MCP tool

=== Storage

* Default to persistent storage backends (RocksDB for graph, file-based for document)
* Add configuration file for storage paths and options
* Implement proper data directory management

=== Query Language (VQL)

* Complete the ReScript parser integration with the Rust API
* Add VQL endpoint to HTTP API
* VQL REPL for interactive querying

=== Observability

* Prometheus metrics endpoint
* Structured logging with tracing
* Health dashboard
