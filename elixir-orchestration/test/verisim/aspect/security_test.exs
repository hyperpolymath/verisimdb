# VCL security aspect tests.
#
# Validates that the VCL execution pipeline is hardened against the attack
# surface of a multi-tenant distributed database:
#
#   1. VCL Injection     — crafted query strings do not escape their parse
#                          context and execute unintended operations.
#   2. Unauthorised Access — requests without valid authentication are
#                          rejected with a clear error, not silently
#                          truncated or granted partial data.
#   3. Cross-Tenant Isolation — an authenticated tenant cannot read or
#                          mutate octads belonging to a different tenant,
#                          even with a well-formed VCL query.
#   4. Error Disclosure  — error responses do not leak internal paths,
#                          stack traces, or schema metadata to the caller.
#
# No real network connections are made. All adapter/auth calls are
# exercised through the in-process Elixir layer.
