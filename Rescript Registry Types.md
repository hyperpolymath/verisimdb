VeriSimDB: ReScript Registry Type Definitions

These definitions form the backbone of the "Tiny Core". They ensure that every Hexad resolved by the WASM proxy is type-safe and consistent with the KRaft controller's state.

1. Core Hexad Types

type uuid = string // 128-bit UUID represented as hex
type did = string  // Decentralized Identifier for the owner

type modalityType = 
  | Graph
  | Vector
  | Tensor
  | Semantic
  | Document
  | Temporal

type storeMeta = {
  endpoint: string,
  supportedModalities: array<modalityType>,
  policyHash: string,
}

type hexad = {
  id: uuid,
  owner: did,
  modalities: Belt.Map.String.t<storeMeta>,
  policyHash: string,
  lastModified: float,
}


2. KRaft Metadata Log Types

To support the KRaft-style quorum, the registry must understand log indices and terms.

type term = int
type index = int

type logEntry = {
  term: term,
  index: index,
  command: 
    | RegisterHexad(hexad)
    | UpdatePolicy(uuid, string)
    | RevokeStore(string)
}

type registryState = {
  lastIncludedIndex: index,
  lastIncludedTerm: term,
  hexads: Belt.Map.String.t<hexad>,
}


3. The Resolution Logic

This is the primary function invoked by the WASM proxy during a lookup.

let resolveHexad = (registry: registryState, id: uuid): option<hexad> => {
  Belt.Map.String.get(registry.hexads, id)
}
