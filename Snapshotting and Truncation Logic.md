VeriSimDB: Snapshotting & Truncation Logic

To maintain the "Tiny Core" mandate, VeriSimDB uses a KRaft-inspired snapshotting mechanism. This prevents the append-only metadata log from growing indefinitely.

1. The Trigger Mechanism

The Elixir Orchestrator monitors the log size. Once the log reaches a configurable threshold (e.g., 10,000 entries or 10MB), a snapshot is initiated.

defmodule VeriSim.Registry.Snapshotter do
  @doc """
  Initiates a snapshot of the current FSM state.
  """
  def take_snapshot(state_machine_pid) do
    # 1. Capture the current state from the Raft FSM
    state = Raft.get_state(state_machine_pid)
    
    # 2. Serialize to CBOR (compact binary format)
    snapshot_data = CBOR.encode(state)
    
    # 3. Calculate the metadata for the snapshot
    meta = %{
      last_included_index: Raft.get_last_index(state_machine_pid),
      last_included_term: Raft.get_last_term(state_machine_pid)
    }
    
    # 4. Save to disk/store and truncate the log
    Raft.commit_snapshot(state_machine_pid, meta, snapshot_data)
  end
end


2. Log Truncation

Once the snapshot is successfully written and acknowledged by the Quorum:

All log entries preceding last_included_index are deleted.

Memory is freed.

Any new node joining the cluster downloads the snapshot first, then catches up on the few remaining log entries.
